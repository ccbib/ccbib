<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>Introduction to
After the Siege</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">My grandmother,
Valentina Rachman (now Valerie Goldman), was a little girl when
Hitler laid siege to Leningrad, 12 years old. All my life, she told
me that she’d experienced horrors during the war that I’d never
comprehend, but I’m afraid that in my callow youth, I discounted
this. My grandmother wasn’t in a concentration camp, and as far as
I knew, all that had happened is that she’d met my grandfather—a
Red Army conscript—in Siberia, they’d deserted and gone to
Azerbaijan, and my father had been born in a refugee camp near Baku.
That’s dramatic, but hardly a major trauma.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Then I went to St
Petersburg with my family in the summer of 2005, and my grandmother
walked us through the streets of her girlhood, and for the first
time, she opened up about the war to me. She pointed out the corners
where she’d seen frozen, starved corpses, their asses sliced away
by black-market butchers; the windows from which she’d heaved the
bodies of her starved neighbors when she grew too weak to carry them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stories came one
after another, washing over the sun-bleached summertime streets of
Petersburg, conjuring up a darker place, frozen over, years into a
siege that killed millions. Harrison E. Salisbury’s “900 Days”
is probably the best account of those years, and the more I read of
it, the more this story fleshed itself out in my head. I wrote almost
all of it on airplanes between London, Singapore and San Francisco,
in great, 5000- and 6000-word gouts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">My grandmother’s
stories found an easy marriage with the contemporary narrative of
developing nations being strong-armed into taking on rich-country
copyright and patent laws, even where this means letting their
citizens die by the millions for lack of AIDS drugs (Mandela’s son
died of AIDS—imagine if one of the Bush twins died of a disease
that would be treatable except for the greed of a South African
company), destroying their education system, or punishing local
artists to preserve imported, expensive culture.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The USA was a pirate
nation for the first 100 years of its existence, ripping off the
patents and trademarks of the imperial European powers it had
liberated itself from with blood. By keeping their GDP at home, the
US revolutionaries were able to bootstrap their nation into an
industrial powerhouse. Now, it seems, their descendants are bent on
ensuring that no other country can pull the same trick off.</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>After the Siege </I>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">(Published in The
Infinite Matrix, January 2007)</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The day the siege
began, Valentine was at the cinema across the street from her
building. The cinema had only grown the night before and when she got
out of bed and saw it there, all gossamer silver supports and brave
sweeping candy-apple red curves, she’d begged Mata and Popa to let
her go. She knew that all the children in the building would spend
the day there—didn’t the pack of them explore each fresh marvel
as a group? The week before it had been the clever little flying cars
that swooped past each other with millimeters to spare, like pigeons
ripping over your head. Before that it had been the candy forest
where the trees sprouted bon-bons and sticks of rock, and every boy
and girl in the city had been there, laughing and eating until their
bellies and sides ached. Before that, the swarms of robot insects
that had gathered up every fleck of litter and dust and spirited it
all away to the edge of town where they’d somehow chewed it up and
made factories out of it, brightly colored and airy as an aviary.
Before that: fish in the river. Before that: the new apartment
buildings. Before that: the new hospitals. Before that: the new
government offices.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Before that: the
revolution, which Valentine barely remembered—she’d been a little
kid of ten then, not a big girl of thirteen like now. All she
remembered was a long time when she’d been always a little hungry,
and when everything was grey and dirty and Mata and Popa whispered
angrily at each other when they thought she slept and her little
brother Trover had cried thin sickly cries all night, which made her
angry too.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The cine was amazing,
the greatest marvel yet as far as she was concerned. She and the
other little girls crowded into one of the many balconies and
tinkered with the controls for it until it lifted free—how they’d
whooped!—and sailed off to its own little spot under the high swoop
of the dome. From there the screen was a little distorted, but they
could count the bald spots on the old war heroes’ heads as they
nodded together in solemn congress, waiting for the films to start.
From there they could spy on the boys who were making spitball
mischief that was sure to attract a reprimand, though for now the
airborne robots were doing a flawless job of silently intercepting
the boys’ missiles before they disturbed any of the other watchers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The films weren’t
very good in Valentine’s opinion. The first one was all about the
revolution as if she hadn’t heard enough about the revolution! It
was all they talked about in school for one thing. And her parents!
The <I>quantities</I>, the positive <I>quantities</I> of times they’d
sat her down to Explain the Revolution, which was apparently one of
their duties as bona fide heroes of the revolution. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was better than
most though, because they’d made it with a game and it was a game
that Valentine played quite a lot and thought was quite good. She
recognized the virtual city modeled on her own city, the avatars’
dance-moves taken from the game too, along with the combat sequences
and the scary zombies that had finally given rise to the revolution. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That much she knew and
that much they all knew: without the zombies, the revolution would
never have come. Zombiism and the need to cure it had outweighed
every other priority. Three governments had promised that they’d
negotiate better prices for zombiism drugs, and three governments had
failed and in the end, the Cabinet had been overrun by zombies who’d
torn three MPs to bits and infected seven more and the crowd had
carried the PM out of her office and put her in a barrel and driven
nails through it and rolled it down the river-bank into the river,
something so horrible and delicious that Valentine often thought
about it like you poke a sore tooth with your tongue.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After that, the
revolution, and a new PM who wouldn’t negotiate the price of
zombiism drugs. After that, a PM who built zombiism drug factories
right there in the city, giving away the drug in spray and pill and
needles. From there, it was only a matter of time until everything
was being made right there, copies of movies and copies of songs and
copies of drugs and copies of buildings and cars and you name it, and
that was the revolution, and Valentine thought it was probably a good
thing for everyone except the old PM whom they’d put in the barrel.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The next movie was much
better and Valentine and Leeza, who was her best friend that week put
their arms around each others’ shoulders and watched it avidly. It
was about a woman who was in love with two men and the men hated each
other and there was fighting and glorious kissing and sophisticated,
cutting insults, and oh they dressed so <I>well</I>! The audio was
dubbed over from English but that was OK, the voice-actors they used
were very good. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After the second
showing, she and her friends allowed their seats to lower and set off
for the concessions stand where they found the beaming proprietors of
the cinema celebrating their opening day with chocolates and thick
sandwiches and fish pies and bottles of brown beer for the adults and
bottles of fizzy elderflower for the kids. Valentine saw the cute boy
who Leeza liked and tripped him so he practically fell in Leeza’s
lap and that set the two of them to laughing so hard they nearly
didn’t make it back to their seats.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The next picture barely
had time to start when it was shut off and the lights came up and one
of the proprietors stepped in front of the screen, talking into his
phone, which must have been dialed into the cine’s sound system. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Comrades, your
attention please. We have had word that the city is under attack by
our old enemies. They have bombed the east quarter and many are dead.
More bombs are expected soon.” They all spoke at once, horrified
non-words that were like a panic, a sound that made Valentine want to
cover her ears.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please, comrades,”
the speaker said. He was about sixty and was getting a new head of
hair, but he had the look of the old ones who’d lived through the
zombiism, a finger or two bent at a funny angle by a secret
policeman, a wattle under the chin of skin loosened by some dark year
of starvation. “Please! We must be calm! If there are shelters in
your apartment buildings and you can walk there in less than ten
minutes, you should walk there. If your building lacks shelters, or
if it would take more than ten minutes to go to your building’s
shelter, you may use some of the limited shelter space here. The
seats will lower in order, two at a time, to prevent a rush, and when
yours reaches ground, please leave calmly and quickly and get to your
shelter.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Leeza clutched at her
arm. “Vale! My building is more than ten minutes’ walk! I’ll
have to stay here! Oh, my poor parents! They’ll think—”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They’ll think
you’re safe with me, Leeze,” Valentine said, hugging her. “I’ll
stay with you and both our parents’ can worry about us.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They headed for the
shelter together, white-faced and silent in the slow-moving crowd
that shuffled down the steps into the first basement, the second
basement, then the shelter below that. A war hero was handing out
masks to everyone who entered and he had to go and find more
child-sized ones for them so they waited patiently in the doorway.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Valentine! You don’t
belong here! Go home and leave room for we who need it!” It was her
worst enemy, Reeta, who had been her best friend the week before. She
was red in the face and pointing and shouting. “She lives across
the street! You see how selfish she is! Across the street is her own
shelter and she would take a spot away from her comrades, send them
walking through the street—”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The hero silenced her
with a sharp gesture and looked hard at Valentine. “Is it true?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My friend is
scared,” she said, squeezing Leeza’s shaking shoulder. “I will
stay with her.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You go home now,”
the hero said, putting one of the child-sized masks back in the box.
“Your friend will be fine and you’ll see her in a few minutes
when they sound the all clear. Hurry now.” His voice and his look
brooked no argument.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So Valentine fought her
way up the stairs—so many headed for the shelter!—and out the
doors and when she stepped out, it was like a different city. The
streets, always so busy and cheerful, were silent. No air-cars flew
overhead. It was silent, silent, like the ringing in your ears after
you turn your headphones up too loud. It was so weird that a laugh
escaped her lips, though not one of mirth, more like a scared laugh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She stood a moment
longer and then there was a sound like far-away thunder. A second
later, a little wind. On its heels, a bigger wind, icy cold and then
hot as the oven when you open the door, nearly blowing her off her
feet. It <I>smelled</I> like something dead or something deadly. She
<I>ran</I> as fast as she could across the street, pounding hell for
leather to her front door. Just as she reached for it, there was a
much louder thunderclap, one that lifted her off her feet and tossed
her into the air, spinning her around. As she spun around and around,
she saw the brave red dome of the cine disintegrate, crumble to a
million shards that began to rain down on the street. Then the boom
dropped her hard on the pavement and she saw no more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">#</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The day after the siege
began, the doctor fitted Valentine for her hearing aid and told her
to come back in ten years for a battery change. She hardly felt it
slide under her skin but once it was there, the funny underwatery
sound of everything and everyone turned back into bright sound as
sharp as the cine’s had been.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now that she could
hear, she could speak, and she grabbed Popa’s hands. “The cine!”
she said. “Oh, Popa, the cine, those poor people! What happened to
them?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The work crews
opened the shelter ten hours later,” Popa said. He never
sugar-coated anything for her, even though Mata disapproved of
talking to her like an adult. “Half of them died from lack of
air—the air re-circulators were damaged by the bomb, and the
shelter was air-tight. The rest are in hospital.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She cried. “Leeza—”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mata took her hands.
“Leeza is fine,” she said. “She made sure we told you that.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She cried harder, but
smiling this time. Trover was on her mother’s hip, and looking like
he didn’t know whether to stay quiet or pitch one of his famous
tantrums. Automatically, Valentine gave him a tickle that brought a
smile that kept him from bursting out in tears. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They left the hospital
together and walked home, though it was far. The Metro wasn’t
running and the air-cars were still grounded. Some of the buildings
they passed were nothing but rubble, and there robots and people
labored to make sense of them and get them reassembled and back on
their feet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It wasn’t until the
next day that she found out that Reeta had been killed under the
cine. She threw up the porridge she’d had for breakfast and shut
herself in her room and cried into her pillow until she fell asleep.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">#</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three days after the
siege began, Mata went away.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can’t go!”
Popa shouted at her. “Are you crazy? You can’t go to the front!
You have two small children, woman!” He was red-faced and his hands
were clenching and unclenching. Trover was having a tantrum that was
so loud and horrible that Valentine wanted to rip her hearing aids
out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mata’s eyes were red.
“Harald, you know I have to do this. It’s not the ‘front’—it’s
our own city. My country needs me—if I don’t help to fight for
it, then what will become of our children?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You never got over
the glory of fighting, did you?” Her father’s voice was bitter in
a way that she’d never heard before. “You’re an addict!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She held up her left
hand and shook it in his face. “An addict! Is <I>that</I> what you
think?” Her middle finger and little finger on that hand had never
bent properly in all of Valentine’s memory, and when Valentine had
asked her about it, she’d said the terrible word <I>knucklebreakers</I>
which was the old name for the police. “You think I’m addicted to
<I>this</I>? Harald, honor and courage and patriotism are <I>virtues</I>
no matter that you would make them into vices and shame our children
with your cowardice. I go to fight now, Harald, and it’s for <I>all</I>
of us.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Popa couldn’t find
another word to speak in the two seconds it took for Mata to give her
two children hard kisses on the foreheads and slam out the door, and
then it was Valentine and Popa and Trover, still screaming. Her
father fisted the tears out of his eyes, not bothering to try to hide
them, and said, “Well then, who wants pancakes?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But the power was out
and he had to make them cereal instead.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">#</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two weeks after the
siege began, her mother didn’t come home and the city came for her
father. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Every adult,
comrade, every adult fights for the city.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My children—” he
sputtered. Mata hadn’t been home all night, and it wasn’t the
first time. She and Popa barely spoke anymore.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your girl there is
big enough to look after herself, aren’t you honey?” The woman
from the city was short and plump and wore heavy armor and was red in
the face from walking up ten flights to get to their flat. The power
to the elevators was almost always out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Valentine hugged her
father’s leg. “My Popa will fight for the city,” she said.
“He’s a hero.” 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was. He’d fought
in the revolution and he’d been given a medal for it. Sometimes
when no one was looking, Valentine took out her parents’ medals and
looked at their tiny writing, their shining, unscratchable surfaces,
their intricate ribbons.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The woman from the city
gave her father a look that said, <I>You see, a child understands,
what’s your excuse?</I> Valentine couldn’t quite feel guilty for
taking the woman’s side. Leeza’s parents fought every day.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I must leave a note
for my wife,” he said. Valentine realized that for the first time
in her life her parents were going to leave her <I>all on her own</I>
and felt a thrill.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">#</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two weeks and one day
after the siege began, her Mata came home and the city came for
Valentine.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mata was grimy and
exhausted, and she favored one leg as she went about the flat making
them cold cereal with water—all the milk had spoiled—and dried
fruits. Trover looked curiously at her as though he didn’t
recognize her, but eventually he got in her way and she snapped at
him to move already and he pitched a relieved fit, pounding his fists
and howling. How that little boy could howl!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She sat down at the
table with Valentine and the two of them ate their cereal together.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your father?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He said he was
digging trenches—that’s what he did all day yesterday.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her mother’s eyes
glinted. “Good. We need more trenches. We’ll fortify the whole
city with them, spread them out all the way to their lines, trenches
we can move through without being seen or shot. We’ll take the war
to those bastards and slip away before they know we’ve killed
them.” Mata had apparently forgotten all about not talking to
Valentine like a grownup.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The knock at the door
came then, and Mata answered it and it was the woman from the city
again. “Your little girl,” she said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No,” Mata said.
Her voice was flat and would not brook any contradiction. She’d
bossed her nine brothers—Valentine’s uncles, now scattered to the
winds—and then commanded a squadron in the revolution, and no one
could win an argument with her. As far as Valentine knew, no one
could win an argument with her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No?” The woman
from the city said. “No is not an option, comrade.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mata drew herself up.
“My husband digs. I fight. My daughter cares for our son. That’s
enough from this family.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are old people
in this building who need water brought for them. There’s a creche
for the boy underground, he’ll be happy enough there. Your little
girl is strong and the old people are weak.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No,” her mother
said. “I’m very sorry, but no.” She didn’t sound the least
bit sorry.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The woman from the city
went away. Mata sat down and went back to eating her cereal with
water without a word, but there was another knock at the door fifteen
minutes later. The woman from the city had brought along an old hero
with one arm and one eye. He greeted Mata by name and Mata gave him a
smart salute. He spoke quietly in her ear for a moment. She saluted
him again and he left.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ll carry
water,” Mata said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Valentine didn’t
mind, it was a chance to get out of the flat. One day of baby-sitting
the human tantrum had convinced her that any chore was preferable to
being cooped up with him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She carried water that
day. She’d expected to be balancing buckets over her shoulders like
in the schoolbooks, but they fitted her with a bubble-suit that
distributed the weight over her whole body and then filled it up with
a hose until she weighed nearly twice what she normally did. Other
kids were in the stairwells wearing identical bubble-suits, sloshing
up the steps to old peoples’ flats that smelled funny. The old
women and men that Valentine saw that day pinched her cheeks and then
emptied out her bubble-suit into their cisterns.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was exhausting work
and by the end of the day she had stopped making even perfunctory
conversation with the other water-carriers. The old people she met at
the day’s end were bitter about being left alone and thirsty all
day and they snapped at her and didn’t thank her at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She picked Trover up
from the creche and he demanded that he be carried and she had half a
mind to toss him down the stairs. But she noticed that he had a
bruise over his eye and his hands and face were sticky and dirty and
she decided that he’d had a hard day too. Mata and Popa weren’t
home when they got there so Valentine made dinner—more cold cereal
and some cabbage with leftover dumplings kept cool in a bag hung out
the window—and then when they still hadn’t returned by bedtime,
Valentine tucked Trover in and then fell asleep herself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">#</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One month after the
siege began, Valentine’s mother came home in tears. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it, Mata?”
Valentine said, as soon as her mother came through the door. “Are
you hurt?” Her mother had come home hurt more than once in the
month, bandaged or splinted or covered in burn ointment or hacking at
some deep chemical irritation in her throat and nose and lungs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her mother’s eyes
were swollen like they had been the day she’d been caught by the
gas and they’d had to do emergency robot field-surgery on them. But
there were no sutures. Tears had swollen her eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“New trenchbuster
missiles on the eastern front,” she said. “The anti-missiles are
too slow for them.” She sobbed, a terrible terrifying sound that
Valentine had never heard from her mother. “The bastards are
trading with the EU and the Americans for better weapons, they say
they’re on the same side, they say we are lawless thieves who
deprive them all of their royalties—”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Valentine had heard
that the Americans and the EU had declared for the other side, while
the Russians and the Koreans and the Brazilians had declared for the
city. The war gossip was everywhere. The old people didn’t pinch
her cheeks when she brought water, not anymore—they told her about
the war and the enemies who’d come to drive them back into the dark
ages.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mata, are you <I>hurt</I>?”
Her mother was covering her face with her hands and sobbing so loudly
it drowned out the tantrum Trover threw every night the second she
came through the door.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her shoulders shook.
She gulped her sobs. Then she lowered her wet, snotty, sticky hands
and wiped them on the thighs of her jumpsuit. She hugged Valentine so
hard Valentine felt her skinny ribs creak.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They killed your
father, Vale,” she said. “Your father is dead.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Valentine stood numb
for a moment, then pulled free of her mother’s hug.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No,” she said,
calmly. “Popa is digging away from the front, where it’s safe.”
She’d expected that her <I>mother</I> would die, not her <I>father</I>.
She’d known that all along, since her mother stepped out the door
of the flat talking of heroism. Known it fatalistically and never
dwelt on it, never even admitted it. In her mind, though, she’d
always seen a future where her father and Trover and she lived
together as heroes of this war, which would surely be over soon, and
visited her mother’s memorial four times a year, the way they did
the memorials for the comrade heroes who’d been martyred in the
revolution.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The death toll was
gigantic. Three apartment buildings had disappeared on her street
with no air raid warning, no warning of any kind. All dead. Why
should her brave mother live on?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No,” she said
again. “You’re mistaken.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“<I>I saw the body!</I>”
her mother said, shrieking like Trover. “I held his head! He is
<I>dead</I>, Vale!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Valentine didn’t
understand what her mother was saying, but she certainly didn’t
want to hang around the flat and listen to this raving.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She turned on her heel
and walked out of the flat. It was full dark out and there was snow
on the ground and wet snow whipping along in the wind and she didn’t
have her too-small winter coat on, but she wasn’t going to stay and
listen to her mother’s nonsense.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the corner a man
from the city told her she was breaking curfew and told her to go
home or she’d end up getting herself shot. She shivered and glared
at him and ignored him and set off in a random direction. She
certainly wasn’t going to stand on that corner and listen to his
lunacy. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were soldiers
drinking in a cellar on another street and they called out to her and
what they said wasn’t the kind of thing you said to a little girl,
though she knew well enough what it meant. Now she was cold and
soaked through and shivering uncontrollably and she didn’t know
where she was and her father was—</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She began to run. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Someone from the city
shouted at her to stop and so she pelted through the ruins of a
bombed building and then down one of the old streets from before the
revolution, one of the streets they hadn’t yet straightened out and
rebuilt. The enemy hadn’t bombed it yet, and she wondered if that
was because this was the kind of dark and broken and smelly street
they wanted the city to be returned to, so they’d left it untouched
as an example of what the defenders should be working towards if they
wanted to escape with their lives.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Down the street she
ran, and then down an alley and another street. She stopped running
when she came to a dead-end and her chest heaved. Running had warmed
her up a little, but she hadn’t had much to eat except cabbage and
cold cereal with water for weeks and she couldn’t run like she used
to.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The cold stole back
over her. It was full dark and the blackout curtains on the windows
meant that not a sliver of light escaped. The moonless cloudy night
made everything as dark as a cave.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, she cried. She
hadn’t cried since she found out that Reeta had died—she hadn’t
even <I>liked</I> Reeta, but to have someone die that soon after your
seeing them was scary like you had almost died, almost.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wizard came on her
there, weeping. He appeared out of the mist carrying a little light
the size of a pea that he cupped in his hand to muffle most of the
light. He was about her father’s age, but with her mother’s look
of having survived something terrible without having survived
altogether. He dressed like it was the old days, in fancy,
bright-colored clothes, and he was well-fed in a way that no one else
in the city was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hello there,” he
said. He got down on his hunkers so he could look her in the eye.
“Why are you crying?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Valentine hated
grownups who patronized her and the wizard sounded like he believed
that no little girl could possibly have anything <I>real</I> to cry
about.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My dad died in the
war today,” she said. “In a trench.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, the American
trench-busters,” he said, knowingly. “Lots of children lost their
daddies today, I bet.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That made her stop
crying. Lots of children. Lots of daddies—fathers, she hated the
baby-word “daddy.” Mothers, too.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s get you
cleaned up, put a coat on you, feed you and send you home, all
right?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She looked warily at
him. She knew all about strange men who offered to take you home. But
she had no idea where she was and she was dark and shivering and
couldn’t stop.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My mother is a hero,
and a soldier, and she’s killed a lot of men,” Valentine said. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He nodded. “I shall
keep that in mind,” he said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wizard lived in the
old town, in an old building, but inside it was as new as anything
she had ever seen. The walls swooped and curved, the furniture was
gaily colored and new, like it had just been printed that day. There
was so much <I>light</I>—they’d been saving it at her building.
There was so much <I>food</I>! He gave her hamburgers and fizzy
elderflower, then steak-frites, then rich dumplings as big as her
fist stuffed with goose livers. He had working robots, lots of them,
and they scurried after him doing the dishes and tidying and wiping
up the slushy footprints. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And when they arrived
and he took her coat, old familiar laser-lights played over her, the
kind of everywhere-at-once measuring lasers that they used to have at
the clothing stores. By the time dinner was done, there were two
pairs of fresh trousers, two wooly jumpers, a heavy winter coat,
three pairs of white cotton pants (all her pants had gone grey once
she’d started having to launder them, rather than get them printed
fresh on Sundays) and a—</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A bra?” She gave
him a hard look. She had the knife she’d used on the hamburger in
her hand. “My mother taught me to kill,” she said. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wizard had a face
that looked like he spent a lot of time laughing with it, and so even
when he looked scared, he also looked like he was laughing. He held
up his hands. “It wasn’t my idea. That’s just the programming.
If the printer thinks you need a bra, it makes a bra.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Leeza had a bra, though
Valentine wasn’t convinced she needed it. But she had noticed a
certain uncomfortable jiggling weight climbing the stairs, hadn’t
she? Running? She hadn’t looked in the mirror in—Well, since the
siege, practically.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s a bathroom
there to change into,” he said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His bathroom was clean
and neat and there were six toothbrushes beside the sink in a holder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who else lives
here?” she said, coming out in her new clothes (the bra felt <I>really</I>
weird).</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have a lot of
friends who come and see me now and again. I hope you’ll come
back.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How come your place
is like the war never happened?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m the wizard,
that’s why,” he said. “I can make magic.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His robots tied up her
extra clothes in waterproof grip sheets for her, then helped her into
a warm slicker with a hood. “Tell your mother that you met someone
from the city who fed you and gave you a change of clothes,” he
said, holding open the door. He’d explained to her where to go from
there to get out to the old shopping street and from there she could
manage on her own, especially since he’d given her one of his
little pea-lights to carry with her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’re not from
the city,” she said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You got me,” he
said. “So tell her you met a wizard.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She thought about what
her mother would say to that, especially when that was the answer to
the question <I>Where have you been?</I> “I’ll tell her I met
someone from the city,” she said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’re a clever
girl,” he said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">#</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One week after her
father died, Valentine stopped carrying water.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s not enough
food,” her mother said, over a breakfast of nothing but dried
fruit—the cereal was gone. “If you—” she swallowed and looked
out the window. “If you dig in the trenches, we’ll get 150 grams
of bread a day.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Valentine looked at
Trover. He hadn’t had a tantrum in days. He didn’t cry or even
speak much anymore.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll dig.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She dug.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">#</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six months after her
father died, Valentine stood in the queue for her bread. It was now
the full heat of summer and the clothes the wizard had given her had
fallen to bits the way all printer clothes did. She was wearing her
father’s old trousers, cut off just below the knee, and one of his
shirts, with the sleeves and collar cut off. All to let a little of
the lazy air in and to let a little of the sluggish sweat out. She
was dirty and tired the way she always was at day’s end. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She was also so hungry.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She and her mother
didn’t talk much anymore, but they didn’t have to. Her mother was
sometimes away on long missions, and increasingly longer. She was
harrying the enemy with the guerilla fighters, and living on
pine-cone soup and squirrels from the woods. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Trover stayed over at
the creche some nights. A lot of the little ones did. Who had the
strength to carry a little boy up the stairs at the end of a day’s
digging, at the end of three days’ hard fighting in the woods?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bread-rations were
handed out in the spot where the cine once stood. She couldn’t
really remember what it had been like, though she remembered Reeta,
the things Reeta had said that had made her leave the shelter, which
had probably saved her life. Poor Reeta. Little bitch. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She was so hungry, and
the line moved slowly. She had her chit from the boy from the city
who oversaw the ditch digging in her part of the ditches. He was only
a little older than her but he couldn’t dig because his hands had
been mutilated when a bomb went off near him. He kept them shoved in
his pockets, but she’d seen them and they looked like the
knucklebreakers had given them a good seeing-to. Every finger pointed
a different direction, except for the ones that were missing
altogether. There was also something wrong with him that made him
sometimes stop talking in the middle of a sentence and sit down for a
moment with his head tilted back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The chit, though—the
boy always gave her her chit, and the chit could be redeemed for
bread. If she left Trover in the creche they would feed him. If Mata
didn’t come home from the fighting again tonight, the bread would
be hers, and the cabbage, too.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">#</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eight months after her
father died, her mother stayed away in the fighting for three weeks
and Valentine decided that she was dead and started sleeping in her
mother’s bed. Valentine cried a little at first, but she got used
to it. She started to negotiate with one of the women who lived on
the floor below to sell her narrow little bed for 800 grams of bread,
40 grams of butter and—though she didn’t really believe in it—100
grams of ground beef. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She never found out if
the woman downstairs had any ground beef—where would you get ground
beef, anyway? Even the cats and dogs and rats were all gone! For
Valentine’s mother came home after three weeks and it turned out
that she’d been in hospital all that time having her broken bones
mended, something they could still do for some soldiers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mata came through the
door like an old woman and Valentine looked up from the table where
she’d been patiently feeding silent Trover before collapsing to
sleep again. Valentine stood and looked at her and her Mata looked at
Valentine and then her mother hobbled across the room like an old
woman and gave Valentine a fierce, hard, long hug.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Valentine found she was
crying and also found that silent little Trover had gotten up from
the table and was hugging them both. He was tall, she realized dimly,
tall enough to reach up and hug her at the waist instead of the
knees, and when had <I>that</I> happened?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her mother ate some of
the dinner they’d had, and took a painkiller, the old kind that
came in pill form that were now everywhere. Take a few of them and
you would forget your problems, or so hissed the boys she passed in
the street, though she passed them without a glance or a sniff.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon Mata was asleep,
back in her bed, and Valentine was back in her bed, too, but she
couldn’t sleep. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Under her bed she had
the remains of her grip sheet parcel, one of the precise robot-knots
remaining. In that parcel was her winter galosh, just one, the other
had been stolen the winter before while she’d had them both off to
rub some warmth back into her toes before going back to the digging. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the toe of the
galosh, there was a pea-sized glowing light. She’d never considered
selling it for bread, though it was very fine. Its light seemed too
bright in the dark flat, so she took it outside into the hot night,
and used it to light her way on a secret walk through the old streets
of her dirty city.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">#</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nine months after her
father died, winter had sent autumn as a threatening envoy. The bread
ration was cut to 120 grams, and there were sometimes pebbles in the
bread that everyone knew were there to increase the weight.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She was proud that when
the bread was bad, she and the other diggers cursed the enemy and not
the city. Everyone knew that no one had it any better. They fought
and suffered together.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But she was so hungry
all the time, and you couldn’t eat pride. One day she was in the
queue for bread and reached out with her trembling hands to take her
ration and then she turned with it and in a flash, a man old enough
to be her father had snatched it out of her hands and run away with
it!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She chased after him
and the shrill cries of the women followed them, but he knew the
rubble-piles well and he dodged and weaved and she was so tired.
Eventually she sat down and wept.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That was when she saw
her first zombie. Zombiism had been eliminated when she was
practically a baby, just after the revolution, years and years ago. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But now it was back.
The zombie had been a soldier, so maybe zombiism was coming back in
the gas attacks that wafted over the trenches. His uniform hung in
rags from his loose limbs as he walked in that funky, disco-dancer
shuffle that meant zombie as clearly as the open drooling mouth and
the staring, not-seeing eyes. They were fast, zombies, though you
could hardly believe it when they were doing that funky walk. Once
they saw prey, they turned into race horses that tore over anything
and everything in their quest to rip and bite and rend and tear,
screaming incoherencies with just enough words in them to make it
clear that they were angry—so so angry.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She scrambled up from
the curb she’d been weeping on and began to back away slowly,
keeping perfectly silent. You needed to get away from zombies and
then tell someone from the city so they could administer the cure.
That’s how you did it, back in the old days.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The zombie was
shambling away from her anyway. It would pass by harmlessly, but she
had to <I>get away</I> in any event, because it was a <I>zombie</I>
and it was <I>wrong</I> in just the same way that a giant hairy
spider was wrong (though if she found something giant and hairy
today, she’d take it home for the soup-pot).</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She didn’t kick a tin
or knock over a pile of rubble. She was perfectly stealthy. She
hardly breathed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And that zombie saw her
anyway. It roared and charged. Its mouth was almost toothless, but
what teeth remained there gleamed. It had been a soldier and it had
good boots, and they crunched the broken glass and the rubble as it
pelted for her. She shrieked and ran, but she knew even as she did
that she would never outrun it. She was starved and had already used
all her energy chasing the <I>bastard</I>, the <I>fucking bastard</I>
who’d taken her bread.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She ran anyway, but the
sound of the zombie’s good boots drew closer and closer, coming up
on her, closing on her. A hand thumped her shoulder and scrabbled at
it and she spied a piece of steel bar—maybe it had been a locking
post for a hover-car in the golden days—and she snatched it up and
whirled around.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The zombie grabbed for
her and she smashed its wrist like an old-timey schoolteacher with a
ruler. She heard something crack and the zombie roared again. “Bread
fight asshole kill hungry!” is what it sounded like.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But one of its hands
was now useless, flopping at its side. It charged her, grappling with
her, and she couldn’t get her bar back for a swing. Its good hand
was in her hair and it didn’t stink, that was the worst part. It
smelled like fresh-baked bread. It smelled like flowers. Zombies
smelled <I>delicious</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The part of her brain
that was detached and thinking these thoughts was not the part in the
front. That part was incoherent with equal parts rage and terror. The
zombie would bite her soon and that would be it. In a day, she’d be
a zombie too, in need of medicine, and how many more would she bite
before she got cured.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In that moment, she
stopped being angry at the zombie and became angry at the besiegers.
They had been abstract enemies until then, an unknowable force from
outside her world, but in that moment she realized that they were
<I>people</I> like her, who could suffer like her and she wished that
they would. She wished that their children would starve. She wished
the parents would die. The old people shrivel unto death in their
dry, unwatered flats. The toddlers wander the streets until sunburn
or cold took them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She screamed an animal
scream and pushed the zombie off her with her arms and legs, even her
head, snapping it into the zombie’s cheekbone as hard as she could
and something broke there too.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The zombie staggered
back. They couldn’t feel pain, but their balance was a little weak.
It tottered and she went after it with the bar. One whack in the knee
took it down on its side. It reached with its good arm and so she
smashed that too. Then the heaving ribs. Then the face, the hateful,
leering, mouth-open-stupid face, three smashes turned it into ruin.
The jaw hung down to its chest, broken off its face.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A hand seized her and
she whirled with her bar held high and nearly brained the soldier
who’d grabbed her. He wasn’t a zombie, and he had his pistol out.
It was pointed at her. She dropped her bar like it was red hot and
threw her arms in the air.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He shoved her rudely
aside and knelt beside the zombie—the <I>soldier zombie</I> she
realized with a sick lurch—that she’d just smashed to pieces.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The soldier’s back
was to her, but his chest was heaving like a bellows and his neck was
tight.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please,” she said.
“After they give him the cure, they can fix his bones. I had to hit
him or he would have killed me. He would have infected me. You see
that, right? I know it was wrong, but—”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The soldier shot the
zombie through the head, twice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He turned around. His
face was streaming with tears. “There is no cure, not for this
strain of zombiism. Once you get it, you die. It takes a week. Slower
than the old kind. It gives you more time to infect new people. Our
enemies are crafty crafty, girl.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The soldier kicked the
zombie. “I knew his brother. I commanded him until he was killed by
a trenchbuster. The mother and father were killed by a shell. Now
he’s dead and that’s a whole family gone.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The soldier cocked his
head at her and examined her more closely. “Have you been bitten?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No,” she said,
quickly. The gun was still in his hand. There was no cure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’re sure?” he
said. His voice was like her father’s had been when she skinned her
knee, stern but sympathetic. “If you have, you’d better tell me.
Better to go quick and painless than like this thing.” He kicked
the zombie again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m sure,” she
said. “Have you got any bread? A man stole my ration.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The soldier lost
interest in her when she asked him for bread. “Goodbye, little
girl,” he said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That night, she had a
fever. She was so hot. She got them all the time, everyone did. Not
enough food. No heat. No vegetables and vitamins. You always got
fevers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But she was so hot. She
took off her clothes and let the cool air blow over her skin on her
narrow bed. Trover was sleeping on the floor nearby—he had outgrown
his crib long since—and he stirred irritably as she felt that air
cool her sizzling skin. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She ran her fingertips
lightly over her body. She was never naked anymore. If you were
lucky, you washed your face and hands every day, but baths—they
were cold and miserable and who wanted to haul water for them anyway?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her breasts were
undeniable now. Her blood had started a few months back, then
stopped. Starvation, she knew, that’s what did it. But there was
new hair in her armpits and at her groin.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She crossed her arms
over her chest and hugged herself. That’s when she found the bite
on her shoulder, just where it met her neck. It was swollen like a
quail egg—the chocolate quail eggs from before, that had grown on
the trees, she could taste them even now—and so hot it felt like a
coal. In the middle of the egg, at its peak, the seeping wound left
behind by one of the zombie’s few teeth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now she was cold as
ice, shivering nude on her thin ruin of a bed with her thin ruin of a
body. She would be dead in a week. It was a death sentence, that
bite.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And she wouldn’t go
clean. She’d shamble and scream and bite. Maybe Trover. Maybe Mata.
Maybe she’d find Leeza and give her a hard bite before she went.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her breath was coming
in little pants now. She bit her lip to keep from screaming. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She pulled her clothes
back on as quietly as she could and slipped out into the night to
find the wizard, clutching her pea light. Many times she’d walked
toward his house in the night, but she’d always turned back. Now
she had to see him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She passed three
zombies in the dark, two dead on the ground and riddled with bullet
holes, one leaning out a fifth-story window and screaming its
incoherent rage out at the city.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As she drew nearer to
the wizard’s door, an unshakable fatal conclusion gripped her: he
was long gone, shot or gassed, or simply moved to somewhere else. It
had been months and months since he’d given her the printer-clothes
and the dumplings and surely he was dead now. Who wasn’t?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her steps slowed as she
came to his block. Each step was the work of half a minute or more.
She didn’t want to see his old door hanging off its hinges, didn’t
want to see the ruins of the brave curves and swoops of his flat and
his furniture.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But her steps took her
to the door, and it was shut and silent as any of the doors in the
street. Nothing marked it beyond the grime of the city and the
scratches and scrapes that no one painted over any longer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She tried the knob. It
was locked. She knocked. Silence. She knocked again, harder. Still
silence. Crying now, she thundered on the door with her fists and
kicked it with her feet. He was gone, gone, gone, and she would be
dead in a week.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Then the door opened.
It wasn’t the wizard, but a well-fed blonde woman in a housecoat
with slippers. She was beautiful, a movie-star, though maybe that was
just because she wasn’t starved nearly to death.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Girl, you’d better
have a good reason for waking up the whole fucking street at three in
the morning.” Her voice wasn’t unkind, though she was clearly
annoyed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need to see—”
She dropped her voice at the last moment. “I need to see the
wizard.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh,” the woman
said, comprehension dawning on her face. “Oh, well then, come on
in. Any friend of the wizard.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flat was just as
she remembered it from that long ago night. The woman gestured at the
kitchen and coffee-smells began to emanate from it. Valentine’d
forgotten the smell of coffee, but now she remembered it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll go wake up
his majesty, then,” the woman said. “Just sit yourself down.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Valentine sat perched
on the edge of the grand divan that twisted and curved along one wall
of the sitting room. She knew that the seat of her trousers—filthy
even before her tussle with the zombie—would leave black marks on
its brave red upholstery.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The conversation from
down the corridor was muffled but the tone was angry. Valentine felt
her cheeks go hot, even through the fever. This place was still
civilized and she’d brought the war to it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Then the wizard came
into the sitting room and waved the lights up to full bright, wincing
away from the sudden illumination. He squinted at her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do I know you?” he
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her tongue caught in
her mouth. In his pajamas with his hair mussed, he still looked every
inch the wizard.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I;” She couldn’t
finish. “I—” She tried again. “You gave me clothes. My mother
is a soldier.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He snapped his fingers
and grinned. “Oh, the <I>soldier’s daughter</I>. I remember you
now. You counted the toothbrushes. You’re a bright girl.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“She’s a walking
skeleton.” The beautiful blonde woman was in the kitchen, tinkering
with the cooker. It was the pre-war kind, capable of printing out
food with hardly any intervention. Valentine was hypnotized by her
fingers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You want sandwiches
and fish-fingers?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Start her with some
drinking chocolate, Ana,” the wizard said. “Hot and then a
milkshake. Little girls love chocolate.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She hadn’t tasted
chocolate in—She didn’t know. Her mouth was flooded with saliva.
The woman, Ana, pressed some more buttons and then took down a bottle
of rum from a cupboard. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Will you have rum in
yours, little girl?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I—”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“She’s a little
young for rum, Ana,” the wizard said. He sat down on one of his
curvy sofas and it embraced him and unfurled a foot-rest. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll have rum,”
she said. She was dying, and she wouldn’t die without at least
having one drink, once.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good girl,” Ana
said. “There’s a war on, after all.” She poured a liquid with
the consistency of mud into a tall mug and then added a glug or two
of rum and pushed it across the counter then fixed one for herself.
“Come and get it, no waitress service here.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Valentine took off her
too-small shoes and walked over the carpet in her dirty bare feet. It
felt like something she barely remembered. Grass? 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The chocolate smelled
wonderful. Wonderful was the word for it. It made her full of wonder.
Rich. Something from another planet—from heaven, maybe. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She lifted the mug and
felt its warmth seep into her hands. She took a tentative sip and
held it in her mouth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was spicy! Was
chocolate spicy? She didn’t think so! The rum made her tongue
tingle and the heat made its fumes rise in her head, carrying up the
chocolate taste and the peppers. Her eyes streamed. Her ears felt
like they were full of chocolate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She swallowed and
gasped and the wizard laughed. She looked at him. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ana’s recipe. She
adds the chilies. I think it’s lovely, don’t you? Aztec
chocolate, we call it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She took another
mouthful, held it, swallowed. The chocolate was in her tummy too, and
there was a feeling there, a greedy feeling, a <I>more</I> feeling.
She drained the glass. Ana and the wizard both laughed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ana handed her a tall
frosted metal cup with a mountain of whipped cream on top and a straw
sticking out. “Chocolate malted,” she said. “The perfect
chaser.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Transfixed in her bare
feet on the carpet, she drank this. A cold headache hit her between
the eyes and that didn’t stop her from going on drinking. Wow! Wow!
Were there tastes like this? Did things really taste this good?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The straw made slurping
noises as she chased down the last of the rich liquid. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sit now,” the
wizard said. “Let that work its magic and then we’ll put some
food down your gullet.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She walked to the sofa.
It was like walking on the deck of a rocking ship, or on the surface
of the moon. Everything slid beneath her. <I>I’m drunk</I>, she
thought. <I>I’m 14 years old and I am drunk as a skunk.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She lowered herself
carefully and sat up as straight as she could.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now, young lady,
what brings you to my home in the middle of the night?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She remembered the bite
on her neck and thought for a panicky second that she would throw up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I needed to talk to
you,” she said. “I needed some help.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What kind of help?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She couldn’t say it.
She had the new kind of zombiism and the soldier had explained it
clearly—the cure for zombiism now was a bullet to the head. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Then she knew what she
must say. The chocolate helped. Her family would love chocolate. “I’m
going away soon and my mother and brother won’t be able to take
care of themselves. I need help to keep them safe once I go.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where are you
going?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The drink made it hard
to think, but that was balanced out by that precious and magical
feeling of fullness in her belly. Her mind flew over all the possible
answers. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have found someone
who’ll take me out of the city and to a safe place.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are there safe
places?” Ana said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, Ana, you cynic,”
the wizard said. “There are many, many safe places. The world is
full of them. They are the exception, not the rule. Isn’t that why
you’ve come here?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re not talking
about why <I>I</I> came here,” Ana said. She nodded back at
Valentine and made a little scooting hand-gesture at her. Valentine
couldn’t decide if she liked Ana, though Ana was very pretty.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need help for my
family,” she said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And why would I give
help?” the wizard said. He was still smiling, but that face of his,
the face that looked like he’d been wounded and never quite healed,
it was set in an expression that scared her a little. His eyes
glittered in the low light of the swooping sitting room. She found
that she had slumped against the sofa and now it had her in its soft
embrace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Because you helped
me before,” she said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I see,” the wizard
said. “So you assumed that because I’d been generous—very, very
generous—to you once before that I’d be generous again? You repay
my favor with a request for another one?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Valentine shook her
head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I will find a way to
repay it,” she said. “I can work for you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t need any
ditches dug around here, thank you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Somewhere in the flat,
a door opened and shut. She heard muffled voices. Lots of them. The
flat was full of people, somewhere. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can do lots of
kinds of work,” she said. She attempted a smile. She didn’t know
what she was offering him, but she knew that she was too young to be
offering it. And besides, with zombiism, you shouldn’t do that sort
of thing. She would be safe, though, and careful, so that he would
live to help her family.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ana crossed past her in
a flash and then she smacked the wizard, a crack across the face hard
enough to rock his head back. His cheek glowed with the print of her
open hand. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t you toy with
this little girl,” she said. “You see how desperate she is? Don’t
you toy with her.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She whirled on
Valentine, who stood her ground even though she wanted to shrink
away. If she was old enough to offer herself to the wizard, she was
old enough to stand her ground before this beautiful, well-fed blonde
woman.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And you,” Ana
said. “You aren’t a fool, I can tell. So don’t act a fool.
There are a thousand ways to survive that don’t involve lying on
your back, and you must know them or you wouldn’t have survived
this long. Be smart or be gone. I won’t watch you make a tragedy of
yourself.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ana, what do you
know about survival?” the wizard said. He had one hand to his
cheek, and he was giving her the same glittering look he’d given to
Valentine a moment before.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just don’t play
with her,” Ana said. “Help her or get rid of her, but don’t
play with her.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go and see to the
others, Anushla,” the wizard said. “I will negotiate in the best
of faith with our friend here and call you in to review the terms of
our deal when it’s all done, all right?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ana looked toward the
corridor where the voices were coming from and back to the wizard,
then to Valentine. “Be smart, girl,” she said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wizard brought her
a plate of goose-liver dumplings smothered in white gravy and then
took a bite out of a big toasted corned beef sandwich that oozed
brown mustard.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right,” he said.
“No playing. If you want to work for me, there are jobs that need
doing. Have you ever seen stage magic performed, the kind with
tuxedos and white doves?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She nodded slowly.
“Before the war,” she said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You know how the
magician always has a supply of lovely assistants on hand?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She nodded again.
They’d worn flattering, tight-fitting calf-high trousers, cutaway
coats, tummy-revealing crop-tops, and feathered confections for hats.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone who does
magic has an assistant or two. I’m the wizard and I do the best
magic of all, and so I have need of more assistants than most. I have
an army of assistants, and they help me out and I help them out.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m leaving in
five days,” she said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The kind of favor I
had in mind from you was the kind of favor that you could perform the
day after tomorrow.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And you’d take
care of my family?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I would do that,”
he said. “I always take care of my assistants’ families. Do we
have an agreement?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She stuck her hand out
and they shook. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eat your dumplings,”
he said. “And then we’ll get you some things to take home to your
family.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">#</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two days after the
wizard agreed to take care of Valentine’s family, the fever had
become her constant companion, so omnipresent that it she hardly
noticed it, though it made her walk like an old woman and she
sometimes had trouble focusing her eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She arose that morning
and feasted on brown rolls with hard crusts, small citrus cakes,
green beef tea, porridge with currants and blueberry concentrate and
sweet condensed milk, and a chocolate bun to top it off.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Trover ate even more
than she did, licking up the crumbs. She saw him hide two of the
jackfruits under his shirt and nodded satisfaction—he had learned
something about surviving, then.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her mother had not
questioned the food nor the clothes nor her daughter’s absence that
night. But oh, she had given Valentine a look when she came through
the door carrying all her parcels, a look that said, <I>not my
daughter any more</I>. Not a look that refused what she bore, but a
look that refused <I>her</I>. Valentine didn’t bother trying to
explain. She knew what her mother suspected and it was better in some
ways than the truth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her mother drank the
real coffee reverently, with three sugars and thick no-refrigeration
cream. She ate sardines on toast, green beef tea, and a heap of
fluffy scrambled eggs with minced herring, then she put on her
uniform and took up her gun and went out the door, without a look
back at Valentine.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>By the end of the
week, she won’t have to worry about me</I>, Valentine thought. The
fever made her fingers shake, but she still drank her hot chocolate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Trover knew his own way
to the creche, and so Valentine went forth to earn her family’s
fortune.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wizard had given
her a small sack of little electronic marbles, and had told her to
get them planted in no fewer than three hundred locations at the
front and in the places where the fighting was likely to move. They
were spy-eyes, the kind of thing that she and her friends had
exchanged to keep in one-anothers’ rooms before the war, so they
could sneak midnight conversations in perfect encrypted secrecy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I’m caught,”
she said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ll be shot,”
he said. “You <I>must be</I>. The alternative is that you’ll lead
them back to me. And if you do that, the whole game is up—your
family’s lives, my life, your life, the lives of all my assistants
and friends will be forfeit. It will be terrible. They will destroy
this place. They will destroy your home, too.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She didn’t report for
her digging. That was OK. Lots of people didn’t show up to dig on
the days when they were feeling too weak to hold a shovel. She
wouldn’t be missed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She had the fastest
shoes that the wizard could print for her on her feet, though she’d
carefully covered them in grime and dirt so they wouldn’t stand
out. And she’d taken an inhaler along that would make her faster
still. He’d warned her to keep eating after she took the inhaler,
or she’d starve to death before the day was out. The pockets on
both thighs of her jumpsuit were stuffed with butterballs wrapped
around sugared kidneys and livers, stuff that would sustain her no
matter how many puffs she took.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No one challenged her
on the way to the front. There were some her age who fought and many
more who served those who fought, bringing forward ammunition,
digging new trenches right at the front. The pay for this was better
than the pay she’d gotten digging in the “safe” trenches. She
brought a shovel for camouflage.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first round of
trenches were familiar, the same kinds she’d been digging in for
months now. She even saw some of the diggers she’d dug alongside
of, nodding to them though her heart was thumping. <I>You’ll be
shot</I>, she thought, and she palmed an electronic eye and stuck it
to the wall of a trench. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She moved forward and
forward, closer to the fighting. It had always been a dull, distant
rattle, the fighting, never quite gone, but not always there, either.
Instinctively, she’d kept her distance from it, always moving away
from it. Today she moved toward it and her blood sang. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One trench over there
came the dread <I>zizz</I> sound of a trenchbuster and she threw
herself down. There were anti-busters in the trenches, too, but they
didn’t always work. The trench-busters were mostly up around the
front, but they sometimes came back to the diggers, and they had
killed one crew she knew of.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were screams from
the next trench, then a sound like a bag of gravel being poured
out—that was the anti-buster, she knew—and the trenchbuster
soared out overhead of her and detonated in the sky, mortally
confused by the counter-logic in the anti-buster.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She realized that she
had peed herself. Just a little, just a few drops that must have
escaped when she gave her involuntary shriek. She planted her hands
in the frozen dirt of the trench-floor and got to her knees. That was
when she saw the fingertip, shriveled and frozen, lying just a few
inches from her. It had been cleanly severed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She had seen so much
death, but the fingertip, cut off and left here to dry out and be
trampled down into the dirt; It made her stomach do slow somersaults.
She threw up a little, and peed herself a little more, and her eyes
watered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That’s when she knew
she couldn’t complete the wizard’s mission. There was death ahead
for her that day, much death to see at the front, and she couldn’t
face that. Not when her pockets were full of spy-eyes and that meant
espionage, meant that the wizard was on the other side, the side of
the bastards whose old people she would starve in their high flats
and whose children she would tear from their beloved parents.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fever made her
shake hard now. Her head swam and the world pitched and yawed like a
ship in heavy seas.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She stood up and took a
step. It was a funky disco-dancer step. Her next step was, too. Then
she was walking normally again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She reached down into
her shirt, between her breasts—she had a bra on again, fresh from
the wizard’s printer—and withdrew the inhaler he’d given her.
She’d be dead in a week. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She put the inhaler to
her lips and drew in a deep breath while squeezing it, and then the
fever was gone. The horror was gone. The fear and cold were gone.
What was left behind was a hard, frenetic grin, something that
sharpened her every sense and set her feet alight like the most
infectious of dance music. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She ran now, flying
through the trenches. The closer she got to the front the worse it
smelled, but that was OK, bad smells were fine by her. Body parts—the
fingertip had just been a preview, here you could find jawbones and
tongues, hands and feet, curled-in cocks and viscera that glistened
through its dust-crust—not a problem. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She planted five eyes,
then crouched to let a trenchbuster sail over her head. She resisted
a mad urge to reach up and stick an eye to it, then planted another
eye, palming it and sticking it right under the nose of a gunnery
sergeant who was hollering at two old women who were struggling to
maneuver a gigantic, multi-part weapon into position. To Valentine,
the women looked old enough to be from the same tribe she’d hauled
water for, and they were so thin they looked like they were made of
twisted-together wires. Their eyes were huge and round and showed the
whites.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sergeant paid her
no mind as she slipped forward, her shovel still in one hand. The
trench dead-ended ahead of her and she jigged to a side trench, but
soon that, too, dead-ended. Dead end after dead end—each got its
own eye—and before long she was at the end of the road, no more
side tunnels. She would have to turn back and try another path. There
were no maps of the trenches, of course. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She had another puff
off her inhaler. Her stomach lurched and then her knees gave way. She
was back in the dirt now and she remembered what the wizard had told
her about eating when she was on the inhaler or starving to death.
Then she went into seizure. Her limbs thrashed, her head shook back
and forth, she banged her forehead into the dirt. A gargling escaped
her throat, nothing at all like words or any other human sound.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the seizure
passed—and it did pass, though it felt like it never would—she
shakily withdrew a fistful of butter-ball and sugared organ meat and
shoved it in her mouth. Most of it escaped, but some of it got down
her throat and her hands were steadier in a moment, enabling her to
eat more. She got to her knees, she got to her feet, she ate some
more and had another puff off the inhaler.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">God oh god! She felt
<I>marvelous</I> now. Food and the inhaler were magic together. Dead
ends, pah! Who had time to go back through the trenches? She’d be
dead in five days. She jammed her fingers in the frozen dirt on the
trench-side and hauled herself up to the surface.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In her months and
months of digging in the trenches, she had never once peeked over the
edge. There were things that watched for snoopy looks over the
trenches, laser scanners and sentry guns. You could lose the top of
your head zip-zap.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now she was on the
surface. It was like the surface of the moon. Craters, hills,
trenches, and great clouds of roiling smoke and dust. Nothing alive.
Broken guns and things that might have been body parts. She grinned
that hard grin, because there was no one else here and so she was the
queen of the surface, the bloody angel of the battlefield. She fisted
more sugared liver into her gob and <I>ran</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Zizz, zizz, zizz. There
were bullets and other materiel around her, as soon as she moved, but
the world was so clear now, the grey light so pure, the domain so
utterly hers, there was no chance she’d be hit by a bullet. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She leapt a trench and
skirted a trench, leapt and skirted, heading further and further
toward the lines. She nearly tripped over a sentry gun, then leapt <I>on
top of it</I> as it tried to swivel around to get her in its sights,
and she pasted an eye on it and laughed and leapt away.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She was thinking that
she should get back into a trench and was trying to pick one when it
was decided for her—she was in mid-leap over a trench when a bullet
clipped the heel of her shoe and she tumbled down into the trench.
She did a tremendous, jarring face-plant into the planks below and
lay stunned for a moment with her mouth filling up with blood. Her
tongue throbbed—it had been bitten—and as she carefully rolled it
around her mouth, she discovered that she’d knocked out one of her
front teeth. Not such a pretty girl anymore, but she’d be dead in
less than five days.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She got to her knees
again and planted an eye as she looked around. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A soldier was staring
at her from the end of her current trench. He was saying something,
but here the trenches boomed with artillery and zizzed with gunfire
and hearing was impossible. She drew closer to him to hear what he
had to say and she was practically upon him when she realized that he
was wearing an enemy uniform. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She was quick quick,
but he was quicker and he had her arm in an iron grip before she
could pull away.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He said something in a
language that they often spoke in the movies, back where there was a
cine across from her block of flats. She knew a few words of that
language. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Friend!” she said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He said something in a
different language, but she didn’t recognize that one. Then he
switched to Hindi, but all she knew to say in Hindi was Love Love
Love I’m in Love, which was the chorus to all the songs in the
Hindi movies. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He shook her arm hard.
He was angry with her, and his gun was in his other hand now, a soft,
floppy handgun like a length of rope and he was gesturing at her and
shouting. He was as well-fed as the wizard, and he was not much older
than her. She thought that he didn’t want to kill her and was angry
because he was going to have to. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She tried smiling at
him. He scowled hard. She held her hand out to him and touched his
arm softly, placatingly. Then she pointed at her pocket, where the
butterballs were. Very slowly, she reached into it. He watched her
with suspicious eyes, the handgun trained on her now. She thought
that if she was a suicide bomber, he’d be dead now, and that made
her feel a little better about the war: if this was what a soldier
from the other side was like, they all had a chance after all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She drew out a
butter-ball and took a bite of it, then offered it to the soldier. He
looked like he wanted to cry. She held it to his mouth so he wouldn’t
have to let go of her or the gun in order to eat it. He took a small,
polite bite, chewed and swallowed. She had a bite, then gave him one.
They ate like that until the butter-ball was gone, and then she drew
out another, and another. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She pointed to herself.
“Valentine,” she said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He shook his head. He
was the picture of moroseness. “Withnail,” he said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pleased to make your
acquaintance, Withnail,” she said in his language, another useful
phrase culled from the cine, though she suspected she was pronouncing
it all wrong. She held out her hand to shake his. He holstered his
handgun and shook her hand.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to go,
Withnail.” She couldn’t say this in his language, but she spoke
slowly and as clearly as she could.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He shook his head
again. She covered his hand on her arm with her own and gave it a
squeeze. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To save my family,”
she said. “I’m on a mission for your side anyway. Let me go,
Withnail.” She gave his hand another squeeze. Slowly, he released
her arm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was very handsome,
she saw now, with a good chin and sensuous lips. She’d never kissed
a boy and she’d be dead in four days and a little more. Or maybe
she’d be dead that afternoon, if she couldn’t get back into her
own trenches.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She put her hand on the
back of his neck and pulled his face to hers and gave him a dry, hard
kiss on those pouting lips. It made her blood sing, and she gave him
a hug, too, pressing her body to him. He kissed her back after a
moment, surprised. His tongue probed at her closed lips and she
pulled away, then for a crazy moment she thought of biting him and
giving him a dose of zombiism to spread to his comrades in the
trenches with him. But that wouldn’t be right. They were friends
now.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She stuck her fingers
in the trench wall. They hurt—she must have broken a finger before.
She hauled herself up and began to run, pawing her pockets for her
inhaler. “So long, Withnail!” It was another phrase she knew from
the cine.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">#</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three days after being
bitten by the zombie, Valentine woke up with her hand curled
protectively over the huge hot egg on her collarbone. She couldn’t
move that arm this morning, not without pain like nothing she’d
ever felt. Her face ached. Her limbs ached. Her new breasts ached
like she’d been punched in them, repeatedly. She got out of bed
like an old woman and crept to the table.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She sat gingerly and
spooned up some cereal. Her mother sat opposite her, staring over her
shoulder. Valentine ate a spoonful of cereal, then spat it out as it
came into contact with the raw, toothless spot on her gum.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her mother looked at
her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Open your mouth,
Vale,” she said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Valentine did as she
was bade, showing the gap in her teeth. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You were hit?” her
mother said. Valentine didn’t answer. She didn’t trust herself to
speak with her mother looking at her like that. “They won’t want
you now you’ve lost that tooth,” she said. “You can go back to
digging now.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She stood up from the
table without a word and went out of the flat. She was so feverish
that she couldn’t tell if the stairs went down or up, whether she
was descending or ascending. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She tottered out on the
street. The way she felt, she couldn’t walk properly. Her hips
wanted to give way with every step and so she walked like a funky
disco dancer through the early, cold streets, toward the wizard’s
house. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She didn’t make it.
Less than half way there, she sat down on a pile of rubble and
retched. She reached down into her pocket and pulled out the wizard’s
inhaler, but she fumbled it. She couldn’t bend over to get it, so
she let herself slowly fall to the street, then she crawled one-armed
to it. She fitted it to her mouth and then squeezed it with clumsy
fingers. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She dragged herself to
her feet, not bothering to take the inhaler with her. Her limbs
burned now and wanted to move, no matter how much it hurt, and she
lurched to the wizard’s door, moaning in the back of her throat.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ana let her in, eyes
wide. “You did it.” It might have been a question. Valentine let
herself slide to the soft, sweet-smelling carpet and closed her eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">#</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An unknowable number of
hours or days after Valentine got to the wizard’s flat, she woke up
in a soft, fluffy bed that was quietly massaging her limbs. She was
dressed in loose cotton pajamas, and there was a trolley by the bed
piled high with the kind of fruit that wasn’t a berry and wasn’t
an orange, but a little of both and each one had a different smiley
face growing in the peel.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wizard came into
the room.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ll live,” he
said. “Probably. It would have been a certainty if you’d fucking
told me you had zombiism, you little idiot.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ana came in behind him.
“Do you think she would have done your mission for you if she
didn’t have zombiism, wizard?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He waved her off.
“You’ve got your cure,” he said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It won’t cure me,”
Valentine said. Her voice was like a gravel-mixer. “Not the kind I
have. There’s no cure.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh ho,” the wizard
said. “Would you care to make a wager on that? How about this: if
you die, I take care of your family. If you live, you work for me—and
I’ll take care of your family.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You already must
take care of my family,” she said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wizard’s eyes
glittered. “I think that curing your zombiism is repayment enough,
so I’ve unilaterally renegotiated the terms of our deal. If you
don’t like that, I can arrange to have you re-infected and we can
go back to the original contract.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve cured me?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ana said, “There are
lots of things we have access to here that you can’t get in the
city. What you had would have killed you if he hadn’t helped.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Will you take my
bet?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She thought about the
mission, about the soldier, about being queen of the battlefield. She
thought about the way they’d bombed her city and how she’d just
helped them kill the city’s soldiers and diggers—like her father.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I won’t betray my
city to its enemies ever again.” She sat up very straight. “I was
a traitor once, but I had a fever and I was dying. You are a traitor
every day and what is <I>your</I> excuse?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A traitor? What the
hell are you talking about?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The spy-eyes I
planted so our enemies can spy on us, the wealth you have around
here. How many of our people died because you sold them out?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Valentine, you are a
smart girl and your mother is a soldier, but you aren’t so very
smart as all that. You are a stupid girl sometimes. Our little palace
here isn’t full of spies. We’re <I>documentarians</I>. We shoot
the war and we send it to the outside world so they can see the
tragedy they are wreaking here. We have a huge activist movement that
we fuel through our pictures. The spy-eyes you planted yesterday are
now streaming 24/7 to activist sites in fifty countries. It is being
played in the halls of the United Nations.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ana made a spitting
sound. “It’s being played as filler on the snowy slopes of upper
cable. It’s being played as ironic snuff-porn in dorm rooms. It’s
being used as stock footage for avant-garde performance art. Please,
wizard, please. She deserves to know the real situation, not the
things you tell yourself when you can’t sleep.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s—<I>entertainment</I>?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s riveting,”
Ana said, like <I>riveting</I> meant <I>terrible</I>. “Very highly
rated.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And it raises
consciousness,” the wizard said. “You cynic, Ana, you can’t see
anything except the worst. It is the reason that anyone except for a
few policy wonks have heard of what’s going on here.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Entertainment?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Entertainment,”
the wizard said. “And more than that.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They’re killing
us, they’re gassing us, they’re bombing us, and you’re selling
back to them as <I>entertainment</I>?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She climbed out of the
bed. She hurt, but not so much as she had before. The fever had
broken, at least. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Am I cured?” she
asked. “Do I need anything else, or am I cured?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wizard scowled.
“Now wait a moment—”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’re cured,”
Ana said. “You should rest for a few days and eat well, but you
will get better no matter what.” The wizard turned and shoved her
toward the door, so hard she stumbled and hit the jam. She spat on
the floor and walked out of the room.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Valentine pulled
herself out of the bed. The wizard took her wrist and without
hesitating, she jammed her thumb into his eye-socket, grunting with
the effort. He shouted and reeled away and she made her way out of
the bedroom and down the corridor to the brave red sitting room. Ana
had a couple of grip-sheeted, robot-tied parcels for her. “Clothes,”
she said. “Food. Don’t come back. I’m not from here, but even I
know how wrong this is. He—there’s no excuse for him. Go.” She
handed Valentine some shoes—good sturdy work-boots, still warm from
the printer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">#</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six months after she
took home the clothes that Ana had given her, Valentine was taken off
of ditch-digging and put on corpse-duty. They were dying like flies,
and the zombies fed on them, and unless the meat was disposed of, the
zombies would multiply like rats.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was only bread on
alternate days now. The hunger was like a playmate or a childhood
enemy that taunted her. It woke her in the night like a punch in the
gut. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first body she
found was missing its ass-cheeks. You could find the bodies by the
smell, and she was on corpse-detail with a boy about her age whose
face she never saw, because it was covered by a mask. He had a floppy
machine-pistol that she hoped he knew how to use, because the zombies
were everywhere. He’d been hauling meat for weeks, and grunted out
little bits and pieces to help her get acquainted. Neither of them
exchanged names.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What happened to
her—”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ever see
black-market meat? The ass is the last part to go when they starve.
The mafiyehs take the cheeks and grind them up with some filler and
add flavoring agent and sell it. They used to kill people and take
the meat that way, but they don’t need to do that anymore. There’s
enough meat from natural causes.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The smell was terrible.
It was a woman and she’d been dead for some time. It was hot out,
too. Valentine’s mask didn’t really seem to help, but when she
stuck a finger under it to scratch her sweaty upper lip, an
unfiltered gulp of air went up her nose and she gagged.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They started in the
early hours of the morning before the heat got too bad. They slept
for a few hours at noon, then started again mid-afternoon. She was so
hungry that she was dizzy. The next corpse was on the fifteenth
storey of a block of revolutionary-era flats. No lift in the city had
worked in more than a year. They climbed and rested, climbed and
rested. There was no question of going straight up. She was too weak
to consider it for a second.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was a man. He was
big and tall, and even starved out as he was, they could barely lift
him. He must have been a giant in life.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll never carry
him down all those stairs,” the boy said. “Go and open the big
window.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Valentine obeyed
woodenly. She knew that if you couldn’t carry the body, you’d
have to get it out of the building some other way. She knew that. She
didn’t want to think about what it meant, but she knew it. There’d
been a corpse one floor down from her flat and it had taken weeks for
the city to dispose of it and life had been almost unbearable for
everyone in the building. And that had been winter, when the cold
kept the smell down some.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So you had to get rid
of the body. The window was a revolutionary window. It was marvelous
and self-cleaning and it swung easily open. Forty-five meters below,
she could see the building’s deserted courtyard and the
corpse-wagon that the boy drove haltingly through the city streets.
Under other circumstances she might have felt show-offy and
ostentatious riding in a car while everyone else walked, but she knew
that no one envied her her ride in the corpse-wagon.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take his ankles.”
With the mask on, the boy looked like a horse, and she knew she did,
too. On the one chair that hadn’t been burned for fuel the previous
winter, the boy had stacked up the few possessions the corpse had: a
ring, a lighter, a clasp-knife, a little set of headphones with their
charge-lights showing red.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She picked up the body
by the ankles. The boy had him by the shoulders. When they
alley-<I>oop</I>ed it up off the floor, the body let loose a
tremendous, evil fart. It wasn’t the first time a body had done
that on that day, but it was the loudest and evilest of all the
farts. Its ankles were dirty and the smell of its feet and its fart
combined into a grey, fuggy miasma that she could smell through the
mask.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You should smell his
feet,” she said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You should smell his
breath,” the boy said. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They dragged the body
to the window and one, two, three, swung it out into the wide world.
She watched it spin away, fascinated and wordless. Then it hit the
ground and the sound. And the way it looked. And the splash. And the
blood.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were tears
streaming down her face, fouling her mask. She stepped out into the
corridor and ripped the mask off and faced the wall, groaning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It gets easier
later,” the boy said, tugging her arm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was right.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But they needed shovels
to get the body into the corpse wagon. Some of the bits had gone a
long way off and she had to carry them before her on the spade-end of
the shovel. His viscera glistened like an accusation at her. She
lived on the fourteenth floor. When her time came, she’d go out the
window too.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">#</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two years after the
siege began, she awoke deaf. Mata was shaking her vigorously and her
lips were moving, but there was no sound. Valentine listened hard and
made out a distant, underwater sound that she couldn’t place,
though it was familiar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mata was thin and hard
now, and slept with a gun and only came home for a few hours at a
time. She was taking lots of different pills, and they made her a
little jumpy. Valentine wondered if the pills had rendered her mother
mute, before she realized that she couldn’t hear <I>anything</I>. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She tapped her ear. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t hear,”
she said. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her mother didn’t
appear to understand. She still shook Valentine hard. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m deaf, Mata,”
she said. She shook her head and tugged her earlobes. She was scared
now, and she sat up. She wiggled a finger in her ear, which was very
greasy. Not even the sound of her finger in her ear carried back to
her mind. Stone deaf.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She was breathing
heavily, but that happened a lot. The hunger made her weepy and she
sometimes cried for no reason. Sometimes in the middle of a sentence
she had to sit down and stare at the sky while her tears rolled down
her throat, until she felt able to go on again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She slowed her
breathing. “Mata,” she said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her mother made a “stay
there” gesture, then repeated it and mouthed the words at her
slowly and obviously. She nodded to show she understood.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She was supposed to be
carrying bodies that day. You could get bread every day if you
carried bodies. One piece on alternate days from the city, one piece
from the black-market in exchange for the loot you could find in the
flats of the starved. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a new girl
that Valentine was training, too. The boy was long gone. He’d tried
to touch her breast, not just once, either, and she’d reported him.
When the supervisor confronted him, he went crazy and tried to attack
the supervisor and the supervisor sent him to the front to carry
ammunition, where, Valentine supposed, he was still working. Unless
he was dead. She didn’t much care which.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But she wanted bread.
The creche had shut down a few months before, but Trover had some
little boys he played with and they sometimes came home with a little
food that he was always careful to share with her, though she was
sure that he didn’t share everything. She didn’t either. No one
did. Mata had a little stash of dried fish under her pillow.
Valentine almost never raided it, though she could have.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Trover was looking at
her. She tugged her earlobes. “I’m deaf,” she said. She thought
she might be speaking very loudly, but she couldn’t tell.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Trover went out of the
flat without looking back at her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She waited for Mata,
but the day crept by and Mata didn’t return. The more she didn’t
return, the more Valentine worried. She cried some, and tried to
sleep. She sucked pebbles for the hunger, and drank the cistern dry.
She carried the chamber-pot downstairs, but the world in silence was
so scary that she practically ran back to the flat once she’d
tipped it out into the reeking collection-point. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She had finally gotten
to sleep when Mata returned. Mata mouthed something at her in slow,
deliberate words, but she couldn’t make it out. Mata repeated it,
and then again. She didn’t get any of it, but Mata’s expression
was clear. No doctors would help her. She hadn’t expected them to. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No doctors could help
her, as far as she was concerned. She knew exactly what had gone
wrong: her hearing aids had failed. Everything from the golden years
after the revolution failed. Old people died when their artificial
hearts or kidneys seized up and withered. Lifts didn’t work.
Printers didn’t work—they’d nearly all died the day the siege
began. The hospitals couldn’t print drugs. The sky-cars fell out of
the sky.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nothing worked. Nothing
would ever work again. Everything fell apart. Her hearing aids were
of that same magical <I>stuff</I> as everything else from the
revolution, so it followed that they would die too.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mata must have known
this. That’s probably what she was saying. If Valentine
concentrated, she could recall her mother’s voice and have it say
the words. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s OK, Mata,”
she said. She knew she was shouting. “It’s OK.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mata cried and she
cried, but she put herself to sleep as soon as she could, and once
she thought Trover and Mata were sleeping, she took out her small
wizard-light and made her way down the silent stairs, into the silent
streets.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She walked cautiously
toward the wizard’s flat. She was deaf, but it felt like she was a
little blind too. Without her hearing, she couldn’t see right, or
balance right. She thought about a life without ears. She’d
probably have to go back to digging, since you couldn’t haul bodies
without a partner and you needed to be able to talk, even if it was
only to say alley-<I>oop</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She walked like a
drunkard, keeping to the darkest streets where even the night wardens
stayed away. She let only the tiniest glow escape from her little
light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She was about to turn
into the main shopping street when a strong hand seized her arm and
jerked her back into the alley. Her first thought was <I>zombie</I>
and she screamed involuntarily and a fist connected with her mouth,
loosening one of the teeth next to her gap. Her head rang like a
bell, the first sound she’d heard since that morning. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The little bead fell
out of her hand and rolled into a crack in the pavement, crazily
illuminating the scene and her attacker. The alley was filthy and
covered in drifts of rubble, and the man who’d hit her was a young
civil defense warden with acne that looked chemically induced. He
didn’t smell good. He smelled very bad. Sick, maybe. Unclean like
everyone, and worse. He was no zombie. He didn’t smell good enough.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She saw his mouth work
and knew he was saying something to her. “I’m deaf” she said
and she knew she said it too loud because he recoiled and then he
punched her harder in the mouth than before.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She fell down this time
and he dragged her roughly by one arm away from the light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She was cried out, and
weak from hunger, and she understood what was coming next when he
threw her down and grabbed the collar of her shirt and ripped it away
from her, then gave her bra the same treatment. She was dazed from
the knocks on the head, but she knew what was coming.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Valentine’s mother
was a soldier. She’d been taught to kill. She’d taught Valentine
to kill. Valentine never left the house without a clasp-knife, the
knife she’d taken from the corpse she’d thrown out a fifteenth
storey window some unknowable time before.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The knife was in her
back pocket. She watched the boy’s silhouette work at the fastener
of his trousers, while she stole a hand behind her and slowly, slowly
took out the knife. She let herself make silent choking dazed sounds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She knew what was
coming next, but the boy didn’t. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But as he knelt down
and reached out for the snap on her trousers, she showed him what was
next. She took two of his fingers and just missed opening her own
belly. He tried to jerk his arm away, but she had him by the wrist
before he could, and she pulled him down on top of her, making sure
that her knife was free of the clinch, free to slip around behind him
and take him once-twice-three times in between his ribs, then again
into his kidneys. Seeing the splatted corpses she tossed out of
windows had given her a very keen idea of how anatomy worked. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She had never felt so
clearheaded as she did at this work, and the boy on her thrashed and
got her a couple good knocks on the head, and his blood soaked her
bare chest and her face and her short hair. But she worked the knife
some more, going for the throat and then the face. She let him go and
he rolled away and she pounced on him. She worked with the knife.
Soon he stopped moving.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her shirt was in rags,
but the bra-clasp still worked, once she bent it back. The pea-light
was easy to find—it glowed like a beacon. She picked it up and made
her way to the wizard’s.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m deaf,” she
said to Ana. Ana looked the same, at first. And then Valentine saw
that she was holding a cane and leaning on it heavily.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She knew that she was
half-naked and covered with gore, but she also knew that Ana would
not be fazed by this. She squeezed past her and into the brave,
swooping, just-printed sitting room. She fixed herself some coffee
and poured a glug of rum into it while Ana stared at her in some
wordless emotion.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m deaf,” she
repeated, setting down some coffee and rum for Ana. “I could use a
shirt, too. And the wizard, of course.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She remembered how to
use the cooker from the revolutionary days, but it was like
remembering something from a dream. She poked at it, ignoring Ana,
and got it to produce a plate of goose-liver dumplings in white
gravy. She rinsed the blood off her fingers and then ate the
dumplings with them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ana stared at her for a
long moment, then limped out of the room and fetched the wizard.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He said something that
she couldn’t hear. Everyone in the city was old, even the young
people—wrinkled with dust in the wrinkles and missing teeth and
torn clothes. The wizard was forever young. He was clean and
unscarred and well-fed as ever.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Print me some
clothes, wizard,” she said. “These ones are covered in blood. And
I’m deaf, so don’t bother talking to me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wizard stared at
her. She ate a dumpling and licked the gravy off her fingers. Her
stomach had been in flutters since waking up deaf, a not entirely
unpleasant counterpoint to her constant, painful hunger. The gravy
soothed her stomach, the dumplings settled it, the pain retreated. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She was deaf. She was a
murderess. But there was food and it was good. Better than no food,
anyway.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wizard brought her
a pile of warm, printer-fresh clothes. “Your printers never stopped
working, did they?” she said. She was sure she was talking very
loudly and she didn’t give a festering shit. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our printers stopped
working the morning of the siege. Everything did. Everything stops
working. That’s the infowar. The infowar probably is what did for
my hearing aids. They were supposed to last ten years but it’s
hardly been two.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m taking a
shower now,” she said. “You can write me an answer if you’d
like. I promise to read it afterward.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She took herself to the
bathroom and let the shower wash her. There were some tears in her
head somewhere but they couldn’t find their way to her eyes. That
was all right. It was a war, after all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She dressed in fine
printer-fresh clothes and burped a printer-fresh belch. The gravy
taste wafted gassily into her mouth. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wizard had rolled
up one of the sofas and unrolled a big screen in its place, the kind
of thing she used to love to play games on, in the dreamlike fantasy
of yore.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">YOU’RE DEAF?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She nodded. “I have
hearing aids, from a bomb. They weren’t working when I got out of
bed this morning. No warning. They went like that.” She snapped her
fingers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some movement caught
the corner of her eye and she spun around. There were four more
people in the living room, people she hadn’t met before though she
assumed that they belonged to the distant voices she’d heard on her
earlier visits. They had the well-fed look of Ana and the wizard, and
a couple of them were obviously foreign. The documentarians. One of
them was pointing a camera at her. She bared her gap-tooth grin at
the camera and faked a step toward it. The camera-woman cringed back
and she laughed nastily.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your cameras work.
Your printers work. You’re not losing the infowar the way we do.
That’s because there’s a way to build things to resist the
infowar agents, right? That’s why the enemy trench-busters don’t
fail the way our weapons do.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wizard and Ana
conversed briefly, their heads pointed away from her. She grabbed the
camera away from the startled camera-woman and pointed it at them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want to get a
recording of what you’re saying now so once my hearing comes back
I’ll be able to listen. You don’t mind, do you?” She laughed
again and poked her tongue out through the gap in her teeth. All her
teeth were loose now, and running her tongue along the back of them
made then wiggle in a way that was part tickle, part hurt.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wizard got the
idea. He made a keyboard appear on the screen again and prodded at
it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">IT’S NOT QUITE WHAT
YOU THINK VALENTINE</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sure, what do I
know? But you’ve got something, don’t you?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ana nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can fix my
hearing?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ana nodded again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You could try to
kill me while you performed surgery, couldn’t you?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Neither of them said
anything. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m boobytrapped.”
She wasn’t, but it had been known to happen. “When I die, boom!”
She realized that this lie might be too extravagant. Who’d
booby-trap a starved gap-toothed girl? “My mother arranged it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She thought back to the
cine. The food she’d eaten was helping her think, the way it always
did, making her realize what a cloud of fuzz-headed hunger she
usually floated through.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve left a full
description of your operation in a sealed envelope to be opened in
the event of my death.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That was better. She
should have gone with that in the first place. She couldn’t tell if
they believed her. Ana was shaking her head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve got a
doctor here, or someone like a doctor. Whatever’s been done to your
leg, Ana, a doctor did that.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ana pointed at the
woman from whom Valentine had snatched the camera. Valentine passed
it back to her. “Sorry about that.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">#</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The day after Valentine
killed her first man, her hearing came back. The surgery took about
ten minutes and was largely performed remotely, reprogramming the
hardware in her head with something that the doctor kept calling
“hardened logic.” She liked the sound of that.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her hearing came back
slowly, in blips and bloops over the course of a few hours. Then it
was back, better than new. She found that she could hear sounds from
much farther away. The camera-woman also showed her how she could use
a terminal to access the memory in her new ears, which would buffer
six months’ worth of audio. Valentine didn’t think she’d be in
a position to make much use of this feature, as interesting as it
was. There weren’t any working machines in the city.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m going home
now,” she said. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ana was waiting by the
printer, making it output clothes and food as fast as it could,
giving it to robots to tie up in grip-sheets.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Would you have
turned us in if we didn’t help you?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Valentine shook her
head and tried not to smile. “No one would have believed me anyway.
I’m not boobytrapped, either.” 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I didn’t think you
were,” Ana said. She gave Valentine a long hug and kissed her
cheek. “Be careful, OK?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why don’t you
people help us? Why can’t you give our army hardened logic for
their weapons?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ana shook her head. She
was crying. “You think I haven’t asked this? To do that would be
suicide. Your enemies would never forgive us. It’s one thing to
chide them for their slaughter, another thing to end it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Valentine had Ana print
her some convincing rags with bit-mapped filth right in the weave and
wrapped her parcels in them so they wouldn’t be suspicious. She
stepped out into the bright light of a spring day, every sound sharp
as a pin-drop, from distant gunfire to the nearby hungry whimpering
of a baby.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She walked slowly
through the streets. She passed a spot that she thought was the place
where the boy grabbed her, where she’d done her work with the
knife. If that was the spot, though, there was no sign of it. The
corpse-carriers were efficient.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She walked the stairs
to her flat quickly, her full belly supplying her with boundless
energy. As she reached for the door, though, she heard something from
behind it, some crying. Trover. Once he’d cried nonstop. But he
hadn’t cried in so long she barely remembered the sound.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She swung open the door
and saw what Trover was crying about. Mata was stretched out on the
floor beside the one chair they hadn’t burned for fuel. She wasn’t
moving and one of her eyes was wide open, the other squeezed shut.
Trover was shaking her shoulder and crying.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?” Valentine
said to her brother, grabbing and shaking him. “What happened?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He opened his mouth and
let out a howl. He hadn’t spoken in a long time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She knelt at her
mother’s side. Her mother’s cheek was cold. Her arms and hands
were stiff. Valentine knew that stiffness. Anyone who worked on the
corpse patrol knew that stiffness. The front of her mother’s torn
trousers were damp with cold piss, Valentine could smell it. In
Mata’s breast pocket were a couple of inhalers, military grade, the
kind of thing you took if you couldn’t afford to sleep and if you
needed to make your body go. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To Valentine, her
mother looked like a skeleton, something long-buried and not freshly
dead. Compared to Ana, this woman was very ugly and skinny and hard.
Too hard to be a mother. She must have taken the drugs to keep
herself going when Valentine didn’t come home. Maybe she’d gone
looking for Valentine. Maybe she’d gone looking for a doctor. Maybe
she’d gone to the front to kill some soldiers. Whatever the cause,
Valentine had been the reason. It was for her that Mata had killed
herself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Valentine pulled Trover
to her and hugged him. The little boy smelled of his own shit. In her
parcels, she had the food he needed so she cut them open and gave him
some.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She let him eat and
covered Mata with some of the new clothes that she’d brought home.
She knew how to go through a corpse’s pockets efficiently. She also
knew all of Mata’s hiding places in the tiny, grimy flat. Soon she
had Mata’s identification, her sidearm, her inhaler, her rucksack.
There were soldiers Valentine’s age at the front. She could pass.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come on, Trover,”
she said, getting him into a change of clothes, putting good shoes on
him. Good shoes would be important. She didn’t know how much
walking they’d do, but it would be a lot.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She took him down the
stairs, snuffling and weeping a little still, but logy from all the
rich food. She led him to the civic patrol office.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can win the war,”
she said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The woman from the city
wasn’t so fat anymore, but she still had her armor on. She was the
one who’d told father he had to go to the war. She didn’t seem to
recognize Valentine, though.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She stared at
Valentine. “I’m busy,” she said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know a—”
Valentine searched for the word. “A profiteer who has access to
hardened logic that the infowar doesn’t work against.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The woman from the city
looked at her a little longer this time. “I’m very busy, little
girl.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can bring you to
him. He has working printers.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The woman pretended not
to hear her. She stared down at a pile of papers in front of her, and
it was clear to Valentine that she was only pretending to read them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Valentine led Trover to
the woman’s desk and knocked all the papers off of it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s illegal to be
a profiteer. Don’t you want to at least arrest him?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll arrest <I>you</I>,”
the woman from the city said, grabbing her wrist. Valentine was ready
for this. Her mother had taught her what to do about this. She bent
the woman’s thumb back and squeezed it until she tumbled out of the
chair and dropped to her knees.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s enough,”
said an old, old hero. He sounded like he was right behind her, but
that was just her new ears. When she turned around she saw that he
was in the doorway. He was so old now that he looked like a zombie,
and his one arm was pointing at her with shaky authority. “Let her
go.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Valentine released the
woman from the city.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you want to see
the profiteer?” Valentine said, approaching the hero. Her mother
had respected this man, and Valentine decided she would respect him
too.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I will come with
you,” he said. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Will you bring
guards? He is armed.” She thought for a minute. “I believe he’s
armed.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It will be fine,”
he said. He showed her the heavy pistol he wore on his belt.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My brother has to
come, too,” Valentine said. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That will be fine.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old hero walked
slowly and carefully. The soldiers he passed nodded to him and
saluted him. The old people smiled and waved. Valentine came to feel
proud to be at his side. Normally she was invisible in the city, just
another grey, thin face, but with the old hero, she was a hero too.
And she <I>was</I> a hero: she was about to end the war.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old man spoke
creakingly to her as they walked. He remembered her mother, and he
remembered her father. He told her stories of her mother’s bravery
in the revolution, when he’d been her commander, and she felt her
heart race. Valentine was a hero, like her mother. The wizard would
win the war for them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Then they came to his
door. The old man didn’t need her to point it out. He went and
thumped it three times with the butt of his gun. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ana answered a moment
later. She was dressed in old rags, and had left behind the cast from
her leg, limping to the door on a makeshift cane.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hello, comrade,”
she said. She didn’t have her usual accent. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The hero nodded to her.
“Comrade Ana.” He knew her name, without being introduced.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wizard came to the
door. “Comrade hero.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Comrade Georg.”
The old hero shook the wizard’s hand. The wizard was wearing rags
like Ana’s. He had a cunning glitter in his eye and he took in the
street, took in Valentine. “Hello, Valentine,” he said. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This girl tells me
you have contraband,” the old hero said. “It’s my duty to come
in and search your premises for it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Valentine,” the
wizard said, with unconvincing disappointment. “The food you took
from here wasn’t contraband. It was my savings.” To the hero, he
added, “She took the food and I didn’t blame her. Surely she was
hungry. If I had been a little child in her circumstances, I might
have done the same.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Valentine squeezed
Trover’s hand until he whimpered. She didn’t trust her tongue
enough to say anything.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They went into the
vestibule and then turned left into a flat. Now, until this time,
she’d always turned right when visiting the wizard, but now on the
right there was nothing but a smooth, unbroken wall. And to the left,
there was an entirely different flat, barren of furniture as her own
flat, small and dirty and smelling of death.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Search away,” the
wizard said. He tried to put a hand on Valentine’s shoulder and she
shied away and dropped her hand to the waistband of the trousers he’d
printed for her, where she’d hidden her mother’s tiny sidearm.
“You’ll find nothing, I assure you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Valentine could see
that they’d find nothing. All the furniture in the room couldn’t
have concealed a single tin of food. This wasn’t even the right
flat. With her amazing ears, she heard the movement of the wizard’s
associates, the documentarians, in the next flat over.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hear them,” she
said. “Next door. This isn’t the right flat.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the flat you
led me to,” the old hero said. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s through
there!” she said, pointing at the blank wall. “It’s a false
wall!” She thumped it but it was solid and stony. Tears pricked her
eyes. “These clothes!” she said, desperately, plucking at her
shirt and trousers. “He printed them for me! He has hardened logic
printers on the other side of that wall. He could win the war!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wizard shook his
head and smiled at her again. His eyes glittered. “Oh, if only that
were true. To win this war—”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She looked imploringly
at Ana. Ana looked away. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old hero shook the
wizard’s hand with his one remaining hand. “I’m sorry to have
disturbed you, comrade.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nonsense,” the
wizard said. “Anything for the city.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come along,” the
old hero said. “Let’s leave these people in peace.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Trover let himself be
led silently into the street and stayed at her side even when she let
go of his hand to silently palm her mother’s sidearm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your mother would be
ashamed of you,” the old hero said. “She wouldn’t have wasted
the city’s time on her fantasies and vendettas.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She kept silent. She
knew a nearby alley where no one ventured except for people who
disappeared without a trace. Though she wanted to shout at him that
her mother died for the city that the old hero had just betrayed, she
kept silent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When they passed the
alley-mouth, she hastily shoved Trover into it. He gave a cry and
fell over. She ducked in after him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s tripped! Help
me!” she called.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old hero slowly
negotiated his way into the alley and to her side. She was holding
Trover down as he struggled to rise, but she hoped it looked like she
was helping him up. Maybe it did, for the old hero bent at her side
and she stuck the sidearm under his chin and pushed it hard into the
wattle of skin there.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My mother died for
this city, you traitorous worm,” she said, her jaws clenching with
the effort of not shouting the words. “I would kill you right now
if I didn’t think you could be of use to me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old hero’s eyes
were calm. “Lots of people have tried to kill me, little girl.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lots of the enemy
have tried. How many from the city?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lots,” the old
hero said. “Lots of them, and yet here I stand, alive and well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want to go to see
the people who fight the infowar. I’ll kill you if you don’t take
me to them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You want to do what?
You stupid little girl.” His tone still wasn’t angry. “The
wizard there is the city’s best friend abroad. He’s the only
reason our enemies haven’t crushed us. You want to betray him?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I will win this
war,” she said. But she faltered. She had thought that he’d just
been bought off by the wizard, but maybe it was the case that he
supported the wizard’s work. Was it possible? 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We will win this
war, by cooperating with our friends abroad. We can’t afford to
expose them to risk. I don’t expect you to understand, little girl.
This is a very deep game.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The phrase “deep
game” enraged her so much that she almost shot him there. It was
so—<I>patronizing</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She let him lead the
way toward the front. Trover was whimpering now—he’d twisted his
ankle when she’d shoved him—and she whispered to him to be still.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her plan was stupid.
The old hero was going to lead her into a trap, not to the high
command, and she knew it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I suppose I should
just shoot you,” she said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why do you say
that?” He was so calm. What kind of man was this?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ll lead me to
a trap and have me shot or arrested. I have to see the infowar
command. I have to win the war.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You dream big,
little girl. I have been prosecuting the war on our enemies since
before your hero mother was born. The first thing I learned is that
war is the art of the possible. It is possible that we will win the
siege, given enough time and losses. It is not possible that you will
win the war.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So you’ll have me
shot rather than try.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wouldn’t have
you shot if I could help it. I owe your mother that much.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you keep talking
about my mother I will shoot you.” She found his calm tone calmed
her, too. The soldiers still saluted them, the old people waved, and
she supposed that if any of them knew she had the old hero under the
gun, she’d be torn to pieces. But she was calm and the day was a
sunny one.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My apologies,” the
old man said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I could have you run
away and try to find them on my own.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’d never find
them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I found the wizard.
I put a weapon under your chin. I’m fifteen years old and I did
that much. I will find them and I’ll—”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ll what?
You’ll tell them to go to the wizard’s flat to retrieve his
technology? I assure you, if that was to come to pass, there would be
no technology to get by the time you reached his flat.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were getting
closer to the front. The distant gunfire and zizzing trench-busters
were crystal-clear in her amazing new ears.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He gave some to me,”
she said. “My hearing aids failed yesterday and he got them back
online with hardened logic. I have it in my head.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You—” The old
man stopped in his tracks. She almost shot him by accident, ploughing
into him. He turned around, much faster than she’d seen him move to
date. “You have it in your head?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He reached for her and
she jerked the sidearm up. Absently he took it away from her in a
single cobra-swift movement and dropped it in his shirt pocket. He
reached for her again with his one hand and tilted her head, looking
for the small scars beneath her jaw.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He fixed these?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yesterday. I was
deaf yesterday morning.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’re not lying?
If you’re lying, I will have you shot.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“She was deaf,”
Trover said, very quietly. “Now she can hear again. My sister isn’t
lying.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They both looked at
him. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come with me, little
girl,” the old hero said, and he struck off.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">#</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six hours after
Valentine left her dead mother behind in their grimy, bare flat, she
came to the infowar command.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was far back of the
lines, near the old woods at the western side of the city, and the
entrance to it was guarded by five checkpoints. They took away the
sidearm from the old hero at the last one, along with several other
small weapons the old hero was carrying. They searched and wanded
Valentine and Trover, and made Trover turn out his pockets. It
turned out that he was carrying Valentine’s old clasp-knife, which
had disappeared some months before. He handed it to the soldier
solemnly, and she kissed his cheek and tousled his hair and for a
moment, she looked just like their mother and Valentine felt tears
behind her eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re here,” the
old hero said. “Come with me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were three
airlocks to pass through, and then they were put into airtight suits
with breathing bottles. They didn’t have one that would fit Trover,
but the nice soldier who’d kissed his cheek promised to look after
him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Beyond the last
airlock, it was like something from before the siege, clean and bold
and humming with energy. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We keep everything
that works here,” the old hero said. “This is our last cache of
materiel that hasn’t been compromised by the infowar. It’s a
completely sealed space. If a single strand of malware got in, it
would turn epidemic and wipe out everything.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His voice sounded like
it was coming from a million miles away. Shrouded in her breathing
hood, Valentine felt like she was in the first days of a better
nation, a time when everything worked and smelled of sharp
cleanliness, not rot and ruin. Hooded figures walked past them
without a glance. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old hero led her
deep into the maze, then through yet another airlock.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Comrade,” the old
hero said. “A word, please.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The hooded figure to
whom he spoke looked up from its workbench and peered through the old
hero’s hood. Then it saluted smartly and hurried to the old hero’s
side.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“General—” The
hooded figure had a man’s voice, almost as old as the old hero’s
voice. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old hero—the
general—touched his hand to his hood and then pulled a retractable
wire out of his helmet and presented it to the other. The other
patched it into his helmet’s collar. Even with her marvelous new
ears, Valentine couldn’t hear what they said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They released their
umbilicus a moment later and the other one turned to Valentine. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is it true?” His
voice was choked, like he could barely get the words out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In my ears,” she
said. “Hardened logic.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other man danced
from foot to foot. “It can’t be true,” he said. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She nodded. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old man rooted
through his workbench and came up with a wand that he put against her
the back of neck. It was similar to the wand that the
doctor/camera-woman at the wizard’s house had used to figure out
her hearing aids.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have it?” the
general asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have it,” the
other one said. “I have copied it. Whether I can decompile it,
whether I can make anything useful from it—well, we’ll see.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tomorrow, then,”
the general said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other one didn’t
answer. He was hunched over a terminal on his workbench, fingers
punishing his keyboard.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now where?”
Valentine asked as they shucked their isolation suits, the smell of
stink and rot flooding back into her nostrils.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now we clean house,”
the general said. “Get your brother and your gun.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">#</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Twenty four hours after
the wizard cured Valentine’s hearing, she helped arrest him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The general knocked on
the wizard’s door and it swung open. Ana had her cast off again,
had her bad cane. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, comrade?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have business with
you and yours. Bring them out here, please.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ana took in the line of
soldiers in the road before her, carrying weapons from knives to old
gunpowder weapons to small, floppy sidearms and she went ashen.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I knew it would be
today,” she said. She turned to Valentine. “When you came back
this morning, I knew it would be today.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Call them,” the
old hero said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They already know
you’re here.” Smoke emerged from the doorway behind her. “It’s
all destroying itself. There was never a chance of you getting access
to it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The general shrugged
with one shoulder. Valentine wondered if his stump was smooth like a
billiard ball or angry and wounded or shriveled like dried fruit.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She gripped her
mother’s sidearm tighter and watched the wizard emerge. The
documentarians. The wizard’s eyes glittered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s all gone,”
he said. “You won’t get a scrap of it. What a goddamned waste. We
were on your side, you know.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You were very
well-fed,” the general said. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the
documentarians sobbed. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a pointless
goddamned waste. Spiteful, stupid, boneheaded—” The wizard broke
off, looking at Valentine. “Her hearing aids.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Valentine smiled.
“Yes,” she said. “My hearing aids. I’m recording you now. Do
you have any words you’d like to say for the microphone?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wizard’s jaw
dropped to his chest and his whole body sort of crumpled, slumping in
the grasp of the soldier who held him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You little—”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Valentine put a
sarcastic finger to her lips and then made a show of covering
Trover’s ears. She saw Ana smile involuntarily before the woman
turned away.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">#</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three days after they
arrested the wizard, the sky-cars lifted off again. They roared over
the enemy lines, dropping intelligent motes that zeroed in on enemy
soldiers and burrowed up their nostrils and in their ears and in the
corners of their eyes and rattled in their skulls until their brains
were paste and goo.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Four days after they
arrested the wizard, the printers started to supply food and drugs.
Clever wormy robots sought out and inoculated the zombies.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ten days after they
arrested the wizard, the buildings started to repair themselves. The
lifts all worked again, all at once, in a synchronized citywide
<I>whirrr</I> of convenience and civilization.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fourteen days after
they arrested the wizard, the siege ended. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Valentine and Trover
were in the civil defense bunkhouse. They’d buried their mother
that morning, in the woods, in a perfectly square grave that the
robots had excavated for them, amid the ranked hundreds of thousands
that the robots were digging through the woods, marking each with a
small plaque inset to the soil, bearing a name and a date of birth,
and sometimes a day of death, and the legend, HERO OF THE SIEGE.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Trover hadn’t spoken
all that day, but he had tossed in the first shovel-full of dirt at
their mother’s grave. Around them, the survivors had wailed and
torn their clothes and shoveled at the massed dead.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The soldiers laughed
and sang around them, drinking champagne and eating chocolate. The
men hugged them and the women kissed them, even the sour woman from
the city.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The general saw them
sitting in their corner, Trover’s hand in Valentine’s, and he got
them and brought them back into the cells. He handed Valentine a key
and gestured toward the wing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go and get them.
They’re free to go now. Tell them to go far.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ana and the wizard were
sharing a tiny cell, the documentarians were in three other cells.
Valentine turned the old metal key in each lock in turn. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s over,” she
said. “Victory. The general says to go far.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ana hugged her so long
Valentine thought she’d never let go, but when she did let go,
Valentine wished she’d come back. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Valentine never saw
them again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">#</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ten years after the
siege, Valentine got her medal.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ceremony was a
small one. They had almost run out of special medals to bestow on the
living heroes of the siege, and children came last. The only times
she saw Trover these days was at a friend’s ceremony. The rest of
the time, he was preoccupied with his studies. He was training to be
a diplomat. He still had a terrible temper. Apparently this was an
asset at the System Trade Union. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Valentine walked there,
but she was just about the only one. Others flew, either in sky-cars
or on invisible ground-effect cushions. There were a thousand of them
getting their medals today, and she and Trover were placed next to
each other in the long queue, which was alphabetical by surname.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They should have
given you the biggest and first medal, Vale,” Trover said. His
hands were in white fists. “You! You won the war! And <I>he</I>
knows it!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On stage, the general
shook hands with another medal-recipient. He was up to the C’s, and
Valentine and Trover’s last name started with an X. It would be a
while yet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His other arm is
very convincing,” she said. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Trover just fumed. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When they took the
stage, the general looked at them and winked. He gave them each a
medal, then took her by the shoulders and then hugged her to his
breast. He was still thin and fragile, but he was also still quick
and his hug was firm. He pressed his palm to hers and her body told
her he was sending her some data, which she accepted with surprise
but without comment.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Trover led her off of
the stage. She examined her new download. An audio file. She played
it, and it played in her cochlea.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>I found the wizard.
I put a weapon under your chin. I’m fifteen years old and I did
that much. I will find them and I’ll—</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>You’ll what?
You’ll tell them to go to the wizard’s flat to retrieve his
technology? I assure you, if that was to come to pass, there would be
no technology to get by the time you reached his flat.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>He gave some to me.
My hearing aids failed yesterday and he got them back online with
hardened logic. I have it in my head.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>You—You have it in
your head?</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She’d never forgotten
those words, not in ten years, not through the reconstruction or her
years abroad, not in school and not in work. Not a day had gone by
without her thinking of it. Lots of people had ears that could buffer
now, and hers now had a hundred-year buffer along with all the audio
ever recorded on tap for her pleasure, but she never bothered to
rewind her hearing. Those words, in her mind, were all the rewinding
she needed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She sat down hard,
right there, on the sugary grass.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Trover was at her side
in a flash, calling her name anxiously. She was crying
uncontrollably, but she was smiling too. Those words, pulled off of
her ears ten years ago, when they’d gone to infowar command. Oh,
God, those old friends, those words. The wizard and Ana. It had been
so long. Where had the time gone?</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">#</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The next day, she met
an old face.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You!” he said. He
had a thick accent—the kind of accent that said he’d learned her
language the hard way; that he hadn’t just installed it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She looked at him. He
was very familiar, but she couldn’t place him. Maybe if he didn’t
have that silly beard, forked into two theatrical points, the way
they were wearing them in Catalan that year. She tried to picture him
without it. He was grinning like a fool and laughing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t believe
it’s you!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She shook her head
slowly. Where the hell did she know this guy from? She was supposed
to be going to the cine with friends that night—the new show
screened between the trees in the western woods and you walked around
through it and drank fizzy elderflower and talked with your friends
as the story unfolded around you. It was a warm night and perfect for
such things.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You don’t remember
me?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her tooth tingled. The
one that had been knocked out in the trench and re-sprouted after the
siege. Then she recognized him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“<I>Withnail?</I>”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He hopped in place.
“Valentine! You remembered!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She put her hand to her
breast and staggered back dramatically, hamming it up. He was still
very handsome, and she’d never forgotten her first kiss.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What the hell are
you doing here?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have a layover,”
he said. “Tokyo tomorrow. But I wanted to stop and see the place—”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Remember the dead?”
she said. He had been the enemy, after all. How many of her
countrymen had he shot? 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Remember,” he
said. “Remember everything.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How many of his
comrades had died on the day the death rained from the sky? Surely
they had died in great number on that day. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The woods were full of
her dead. Mata was there. And there was the movie tonight. She
touched the medal on her lapel. He had no medal. The soldiers who’d
prosecuted the siege received no medals.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’re here until
when?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tomorrow,” he
said, “first thing.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“First thing
tomorrow. Come and see a movie tonight,” she said. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He looked at her and
cocked his head. She wasn’t beautiful, she knew, but sometimes men
looked at her that way. Something about what she’d done, they could
see it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’d like that very
much,” he said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She played back a
little audio as they walked together, for a terrible silence
descended on them as they walked, awkward and oppressive. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>Would you have
turned us in if we didn’t help you?</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>No one would have
believed me anyway.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Valentine?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Withnail?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you,” he
said. “For the food. And the kiss. It was my very first.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mine too.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The finest one,
too.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She snorted and punched
him in the shoulder.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shut up, Withnail,”
she said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Comrade Hero,”
he said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She let him kiss her,
but only once. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That night, anyway.</P>
