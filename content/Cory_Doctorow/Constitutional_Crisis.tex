\section{Afterword}

I wrote this for a British educational initiative, while I was working 
on my young adult novel, \emph{For the Win}, about unionizing gamers 
and gold-farmers. I'd been struck by Clay Shirky's assertion that all 
online social groups go through a “constitutional crisis” when 
their unspoken norms rub up against some intractable social problem. 
It's always disorienting to discover that you've got different version 
of the rules in your head than the other people you're playing with. 
And there's always the possibility that they've \emph{changed} the 
rules because it's convenient for them.
