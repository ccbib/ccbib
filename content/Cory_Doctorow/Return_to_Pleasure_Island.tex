\section{A note about this story}

This story is from my collection,
``A Place So Foreign and Eight More,'' published by Four Walls
Eight Windows Press in September, 2003, ISBN 1568582862. I've
released this story, along with five others, under the terms of a
Creative Commons license that gives you, the reader, a bunch of
rights that copyright normally reserves for me, the creator.

I recently did the same thing with the entire text of my novel,
\href{http://craphound.com/down}{``Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom''},
and it was an unmitigated success. Hundreds of thousands of people
downloaded the book --- good news --- and thousands of people
bought the book --- also good news. It turns out that, as near as
anyone can tell, distributing free electronic versions of books is
a great way to sell more of the paper editions, while
simultaneously getting the book into the hands of readers who would
otherwise not be exposed to my work.

I still don't know how it is artists will earn a living in the age
of the Internet, but I remain convinced that the way to find out is
to do basic science: that is, to do stuff and observe the outcome.
That's what I'm doing here. The thing to remember is that the very
\emph{worst} thing you can do to me as an artist is to not read my
work --- to let it languish in obscurity and disappear from
posterity. Most of the fiction I grew up on is out-of-print, and
this is doubly true for the short stories. Losing a couple bucks to
people who would have bought the book save for the availability of
the free electronic text is no big deal, at least when compared to
the horror that is being irrelevant and unread. And luckily for me,
it appears that giving away the text for free gets me more paying
customers than it loses me.

\section{Return to Pleasure Island}

George twiddled his thumbs in his booth and watched how the brown,
clayey knuckles danced overtop of one another. Not as supple as
they had once been, his thumbs --- no longer the texture of wet
clay on a potter's wheel; more like clay after it had been worked
to exhausted crackling and brittleness. He reached into the
swirling vortex of the cotton-candy machine with his strong right
hand and caught the stainless-steel sweep-arm. The engines whined
and he felt them strain against his strong right arm, like a live
thing struggling to escape a trap. Still strong, he thought, still
strong, and he released the sweep-arm to go back to spinning sugar
into floss.

A pack of boys sauntered down the midway, laughing and calling,
bouncing high on sugar and g-stresses. One of them peeled off from
the group and ran to his booth, still laughing at some cruelty. He
put his palms on George's counter and pushed against it, using them
to lever his little body in a high-speed pogo. ``Hey, mister,'' he
said, ``how about some three-color swirl, with sprinkles?''

George smiled and knocked the rack of paper cones with his strong
right elbow, jostled it so one cone spun high in the air, and he
caught it in his quick left hand. ``Coming \emph{riiiiiight} up,''
he sang, and flipped the cone into the floss-machine. He spun a
beehive of pink, then layered it with stripes of blue and green. He
reached for the nipple that dispensed the sprinkles, but before he
turned its spigot, he said,
``Are you sure you don't want a dip, too? Fudge? Butterscotch? Strawberry?''

The boy bounced even higher, so that he was nearly vaulting the
counter. ``All three! All three!'' he said.

George expertly spiraled the floss through the dips, then applied a
thick crust of sprinkles. ``Open your mouth, kid!'' he shouted,
with realistic glee.

The boy opened his mouth wide, so that the twinkling lights of the
midway reflected off his back molars and the pool of saliva on his
tongue. George's quick, clever left hand dipped a long-handled
spoon into the hot fudge, then flipped the sticky gob on a high arc
that terminated perfectly in the boy's open mouth. The boy
swallowed and laughed gooely. George handed over the dripping
confection in his strong right hand, and the boy plunged his face
into it. When he whirled and ran to rejoin his friends, George saw
that his ears were already getting longer, and his delighted laugh
had sounded a little like a bray. A job well done, he thought, and
watched the rain spatter the spongy rubber cobbles of the midway.

\tb

George was supposed to go off-shift at midnight. He always showed
up promptly at noon, but he rarely left as punctually. The soft one
who had the midnight-to-six shift was lazy and late, and generally
staggered in at twelve thirty, grumbling about his tiredness.
George knew how to deal with the soft ones, though --- his father
had brought him up surrounded by them, so that he spoke without his
father's thick accent, so that he never inadvertently crushed their
soft hands when he shook with them, so that he smiled
good-naturedly and gave up a realistic facsimile of sympathy when
they griped their perennial gripes.

His father! How wise the old man had been, and how proud, and how
\emph{stupid}. George shucked his uniform backstage and tossed it
into a laundry hamper, noting with dismay how brown the insides
were, how much of himself had eroded away during his shift. He
looked at his clever left thumb and his strong right thumb, and
tasted their good, earthy tastes, and then put them away. He
dressed himself in the earth-coloured dungarees and workshirt that
his own father had stolen from a laundry line when he left the
ancestral home of George's people for the society of the soft
ones.

He boarded a Cast Member tram that ran through the ultidors
underneath Pleasure Island's midway, and stared aimlessly at
nothing as the soft ones on the tram gabbled away, as the tram sped
away to the Cast housing, and then it was just him and the
conductor, all the way to the end of the line, to the cottage he
shared with his two brothers, Bill and Joe. The conductor wished
him a good night when he debarked, and he shambled home.

Bill was already home, napping in the pile of blankets that all
three brothers shared in the back room of the cottage. Joe wasn't
home yet, even though his shift finished earlier than theirs. He
never came straight home; instead, he wandered backstage, watching
the midway through the peepholes. Joe's Lead had spoken to George
about it, and George had spoken to Joe, but you couldn't tell Joe
anything. George thought of how proud his father had been, having
three sons --- three! George, the son of his strong right thumb,
and Bill, the son of his clever left thumb, and Joe. Joe, the son
of his tongue, an old man's folly, that left him wordless for the
remainder of his days. He hadn't needed words, though: his cracked
and rheumy eyes had shone with pride every time they lit on Joe,
and the boy could do no wrong by him.

George busied himself with supper for his brothers. In the little
wooded area behind the cottage, he found good, clean earth with
juicy roots in it. In the freezer, he had a jar of elephant-dung
sauce, spiced with the wrung-out sweat of the big top acrobats'
leotards, which, even after reheating, still carried the tang of
vitality. Preparing a good meal for his kind meant a balance of
earthy things and living things, things to keep the hands supple
and things to make them strong, and so he brought in a chicken from
the brothers' henhouse and covered it in the sloppy green-brown
sauce, feathers and all. Bill, being the clever one, woke when the
smell of the sauce bubbling in the microwave reached him, and he
wandered into the kitchen.

To an untutored eye, Bill and George were indistinguishable. Both
of them big, even for their kind --- for their father had been an
especially big specimen himself --- whose faces were as expressive
as sculptor's clay, whose chisel-shaped teeth were white and hard
as rocks. When they were alone together, they went without
clothing, as was the custom of their kind, and their bodies bulged
with baggy, loose muscle. They needed no clothing, for they lacked
the shame of the soft ones, the small thumb between the legs. They
had a more civilised way of reproducing.

``Joe hasn't returned yet?'' Bill asked his strong brother.

``Not yet,'' George told his clever brother.

``We eat, then. No sense in waiting for him. He knows the supper hour,''
Bill said, and since he was the clever one, they ate.

\tb

Joe returned as the sun was rising, and burrowed in between his
brothers on their nest of blankets. George flung one leg over his
smallest brother, and smelled the liquor on his breath in his
sleep, and his dreams were tainted with the stink of rotting
grapes.

George was the first one awake, preparing the morning meal. A
maggoty side of beef, ripe with the vitality of its parasites, and
gravel. Joe came for breakfast before Bill, as was his custom. Bill
needed the sleep, to rest his cleverness.

``God-\emph{damn}, I am \emph{hungry!},'' Joe said loudly, without
regard for his sleeping brother.

``You missed dinner,'' George said.

``I had more important things to do,'' Joe said.
``I was out with an Imagineer!''

George stared hard at him.
``What did the Imagineer want? Is there trouble?''

Joe gave a deprecating laugh.
``Why do you always think there's trouble? The guy wanted to chat with me --- 
he likes me, wants to get to know me. His name is Woodrow, he's in charge of a 
whole operations division, and he was interested in what I thought of some of 
his plans.''
He stopped and waited for George to be impressed.

George knew what the pause was for.
``That's very good. You must be doing a good job for your Lead to mention you 
to him.''

``That little prick? He hates my guts. Woodrow's building a special operations 
unit out of lateral thinkers --- he wants new blood, creativity. He says I have 
a unique perspective.''

``Did you talk to Orville?'' Orville was the soft one who'd brought
them from their father's shack to the Island, and he was their
mentor and advocate inside its Byzantine politics. Bill had
confided to George that he suspected Orville was of a different
species from the soft ones --- he certainly seemed to know more
about George's kind than a soft one had any business knowing.

Joe tore a hunk from the carcass on the rickety kitchen table and
stuffed it into his mouth. Around it, he mumbled something that
might have been yes and might have been no. It was Joe's favorite
stratagem, and it was responsible for the round belly that bulged
out beneath his skinny chest.

Joe tore away more than half of the meat and made for the door.
``Woodrow wants to meet with me again this morning. Don't wait up for me 
tonight!''
He left the cottage and set off toward the tram-stop.

Bill rolled over on his bedding and said,
``I don't like this at all.''

George kept quiet. Bill's voice surprised him, but it shouldn't
have. Bill was clever enough to lie still and feign sleep so that
he could overhear Joe's conversations, where George would have just
sat up and started talking.

``Orville should know about this, but I can't tell if it would make him angry. 
If it made him angry and he punished Joe, it would be our fault for telling 
him.''

``Then we won't tell him,'' George said.

Bill held up his hand.
``But if we don't tell him and he finds out on his own, he may be angry with 
us.''

``Then we should tell him,'' George said.

``But Joe and this Woodrow may not get along after all, and if that happens, 
the whole thing will end on its own.''

``Then we won't tell him,'' George said.

``But if they do get along, then they may do something that would make Orville 
angry,''
Bill looked expectantly at George.

``Then we should tell him?'' George said, uncertainly.

``I don't know,'' Bill said. ``I haven't decided.''

George knew that this mean that Bill would have to think on it, and
so he left him. He had to catch the tram to make it to his shift,
anyway.

\tb

The soft one with the six-to-noon shift left as soon as George
arrived, without a word. George was used to soft ones not having
anything to say to him, and preferred it that way. He was better
off than Bill --- soft ones always wanted to talk to Bill, and he
hated it, since they never had anything to say that Bill wanted to
know. The weather needed no discussion, Bill said. And as for the
complaints about the shift's Lead, well, one soft one was just
about the same as any other, and Orville had told them that at the
end of the day, they worked for him, not for any Lead.

Joe liked talking to the soft ones. Joe liked to talk, period. He
told the soft ones lies about their childhood in the shack with
their father, and told them about how his brothers tormented, and
even talked about the weather. When he got back home, he told his
brothers all over again, everything he'd told the soft ones.

George had memorised the SOP manual when they came to the Island,
five years before. It clearly said that the floor of the booth
would be disinfected every three hours, and the surfaces polished
clean, and the pots and machines refilled. The soft one with the
six-to-noon shift never did any of these things, which could get
him disciplined by their Lead, but George didn't complain. He just
wiped and disinfected and re-stocked when he arrived, even though
he had to be extra careful with the water, so that he didn't wash
any of himself away.

Boys ran up and down the midway, baking in the mid-day sun. They
reminded George of the boys he'd gone to school with, after the
social worker had come to his father's shack. They'd teased him to
begin with, but he'd just stood with his hands at his sides until
they stopped. Every time he started a new grade, or a new kid came
to the school, it was the same: they'd tease him, or hit him, or
throw things at him, and he'd stand strong and silent until they
stopped, even if it took months. His teachers quickly learned that
calling on him in class meant standing in awkward silence, while he
sat stoic and waited for them to call on someone else. The social
worker could make him go to school with the soft ones, but she
couldn't make him act like one.

George watched the boys carefully, as carefully as he had when he
stood silently in the schoolyard, not seeming to watch anything. He
was better at spotting a donkey than any of the soft ones. When a
boy was ready to turn, George could almost see the shape of the
donkey superimposed on the boy, and he radioed a keeper to pick up
the donkey come morning. He got a bonus for each one he spotted,
and according to Bill, it had accumulated to a sizable nest-egg.

George looked at the inventory and decided that the fudge was
getting a little long in the tooth. He'd start pushing fudge-nut
dips, and by the end of his shift, the tub would be empty and he'd
be able to give it a thorough cleaning and a refill from fresh
stock. ``Hey guys!'' he called to three boys.
``Is anybody \emph{hungry}?'' He dipped a floss and held it up, so
that it oozed fudge down his wrist. The boys shyly approached his
booth. George knew from their manner that they were new to the
Island: probably just picked up from a video-arcade or lasertag
tent on the mainland that afternoon. They didn't know what to make
of their surroundings, that was clear.

``Step right up,'' he said, ``I don't bite!'' He smiled a smile
he'd practiced in the mirror, one that shaped his soft, flexible
features into a good-natured expression of idiotic fun. Cautiously,
the boys came forward. They were the target age,
eleven-to-fourteen, and they'd already accumulated some merch,
baseball hats and fanny packs made from neoprene in tropical-fish
colours, emblazoned with the Island's logomarks and character
trademarks. They had the beginnings of dark circles under their
eyes, and they dragged a little with low blood-sugar. George dipped
two more and distributed them around. The eldest, a towheaded kid
near the upper age range, said,
``Mister, we haven't got any money --- what do these cost?''

George laughed like a freight train.
``It's all free, sonny, free as air! Courtesy of the Management, as a reward 
for very \emph{special} customers like you.''
This was scripted, but the trick was to sell the line like it was
fresh.

The boys took the cones from him timidly, but ate ravenously.
George gave them some logoed serviettes to wipe up with and ground
the fudge into his wrists and forearms with one of his own. He
looked at his watch and consulted the laminated timetable taped to
the counter. 1300h, which meant that the bulk of the Guests would
be migrating towards Actionland and the dinosaur rides, and it was
time to push the slightly down-at-the-heels FreakZone, to balance
the crowds. ``You boys like rollercoasters?'' he said.

The youngest --- they were similar enough in appearance and distant
enough in ages to be brothers --- spoke up. ``Yeah!'' The middle
elbowed him, and the youngest flipped the middle the bird.

``Well, if you follow the midway around this curve to the right, and go through 
the big clown-mouth, you'll be in the FreakZone. We've got a fifteen-storey 
coaster called \emph{The Obliterator} that loops fifty times in five minutes 
--- running over \emph{ninety-five miles per hour}! If you hurry, you can beat 
the line!''
He looked the youngest in the eye at the start of the speech, then
switched to the middle when he talked about the line.

The youngest started vibrating with excitement, and the middle
looked pensive, and then to the eldest said,
``Sounds good, huh, Tom?''

The eldest said,
``We haven't even found out where we're sleeping yet --- maybe we can do the 
ride afterwards.''

George winked at the youngest, then said,
``Don't worry about it, kids. I'll get that sorted out for you right now.''
He picked up the white house phone and asked the operator to
connect him with Guest Services.
``Hi there! This is George on the midway! I need reservations for three young 
men for tonight --- a suite, I think, with in-room Nintendo and a big-screen 
TV. They look like they'd enjoy the Sportaseum. OK, I'll hold,''
he covered the mouthpiece and said to the boys,
``You'll love the Sportaseum --- the chairs are shaped like giant catcher's 
mitts, and the beds are giant Air Jordans, and the suite comes with a 
regulation half-court. What name should I put the reservation under?''

The eldest said, ``Tom Mitchell.''

George made the reservation. ``You're all set,'' he said.
``The monorails run right into the hotel lobby, every ten minutes. Anyone with 
a name tag can show you to the nearest stop. Here's a tip --- try the football 
panzerotto: it's a fried pizza turnover as big as a football, with beef-jerky 
laces. It's \emph{my} favorite!''

``I want a football!'' the youngest said.

``We'll have it for dinner,'' the eldest said, looking off at the
skyline of coaster-skeletons in the distance.
``Let's go on some rides first.''

George beamed his idiot's grin at them as they left, then his face
went slack and he went back to wiping down the surfaces. A moment
later, a hand reached across the counter and plucked the cloth from
his grip. He looked up, startled, into Joe's grinning face. Unlike
his brothers', Joe's face was all sharp angles and small teeth.
Nobody knew what a child of a tongue was supposed to look like, but
George had always suspected that Joe wasn't right, even for a third
son.

``Big guy!'' Joe shouted. ``Workin' hard?''

George said, ``Yes.'' He stood, patiently, waiting for Joe to give
him the cloth back.

Joe held it over his head like a standard, dancing back out of
reach, even though George hadn't made a grab for it. George waited.
Joe walked back to his counter and gave it back.

``We're dozing the FreakZone,'' Joe said, in a conspiratorial
whisper. He put a spin on \emph{We're}, making sure that George
knew he was including himself with the Island's management.

``Really,'' George said, neutrally.

``Yeah! We're gonna flatten that sucker, start fresh, and build us a new theme 
land. I'm a Strategic Project Consultant! By the time it's over, I'll be an 
Imagineer!''

George knew that the lands on Pleasure Island were flattened and
rebuilt on a regular basis, as management worked to stay ahead of
the lightspeed boredom-threshold of the mainland. Still, he said,
``Well, Joe, that's marvelous. I'm sure you'll do a fabulous job.''

Joe sneered at him.
``Oh, I know I will. We all do just \emph{fabulous} jobs, brother. Just some of 
us \emph{have} fabulous jobs to do.''

George refused to rise to the bait. He could always outwait Joe.

Joe said,
``We're thinking of giving it a monster theme --- monsters are testing very 
high with eleven-to-fourteens this year. Dragons, ogres, cyborgs, you know. We 
may even do a walk-through --- there hasn't been one of those here since the 
sixties!''

George didn't know what Joe wanted him to say. He said,
``That sounds very nice.''

Joe gave him a pitying look, and then his chest started ringing. He
extracted a slim phone from his shirt-pocket and turned away. A
moment later, he turned back. ``Gotta go!'' he said.
``Meeting with Woodrow and Orville, down at Ops!''

Alarm-bells went off in George's head.
``Shouldn't Bill go along if you're meeting with Orville?''

Joe sneered at him, then took off at a fast clip down the midway.
George watched him until he disappeared through one of the access
doors.

\tb

Bill was clearly upset about it. George couldn't help but feel
responsible. He should have called Bill as soon as Joe told him he
was meeting with Orville, but he'd waited until he got home.

He'd been home for hours, and Joe still wasn't back. Bill picked
absently at the dinner he'd made and fretted.

``He didn't say how Orville found out?'' Bill asked.

George shook his head mutely.

``Why didn't he invite me?'' Bill asked.
``I always handle negotiations for us.''

George couldn't eat. The more Bill fretted, the more he couldn't
eat. It was long dark outside, hours and hours after Joe should've
been home. Bill fretted, George stared out the window, and Joe
didn't come home.

Then, an electric cart's headlights swept up the trail to their
cabin. The lights dazzled George, so he couldn't see who was
driving. Bill joined him at the window and squinted.
``It's Joe and Orville!'' he said. George squinted too, but
couldn't make anything out. He took Bill's word for it and joined
him outside.

It was indeed Orville and Joe. Orville was driving, and Joe was
lolling drunkenly beside him. Orville shook hands with Bill and
nodded to George, who lifted Joe out of the cart and carried him
inside.

When he got back, Orville and Bill were staring calmly into each
other's eyes, each waiting for the other to say something. Orville
was dressed in his working clothes: a natty white suit with a
sport-shirt underneath. His bald head gleamed in the moonlight. His
fleshy, unreadable face was ruddy in the glow from the cabin's
door. George bit his tongue to keep from speaking.

``He's drunk,'' Orville said, at last. Orville didn't beat around
the bush.

``I can see that,'' Bill said. ``Did you get him drunk?''

``Yes, I did. We were celebrating.''

Bill's eyes narrowed. ``So you know.''

Orville smiled.
``Of course I know. I set it up. I thought you'd approve: Joe clearly needed 
something to keep him out of trouble.''

Bill said, ``This will keep him out of trouble?''

Orville leaned against the cart's bumper, pulled out a pipe,
stuffed it and lit it. He puffed at it, and watched the smoke wisp
away in the swamp breezes.
``I think that Joe's going to really like life with the Imagineers. They're 
Management's precious darlings who can do no wrong. Anything they ask for, they 
get. There won't be any more discipline problems.''

Bill said, ``Why not?''

Orville grinned without showing his teeth.
``Where there's no discipline, there're no discipline problems. He can work 
whatever hours he wants. He'll have access to anything he needs: budget, staff, 
an office, whatever. It's his dream job.''

Bill said, ``I don't like this.''

George wondered why not. It sounded pretty good to him.

Orville puffed at his pipe.
``Like it or not, I think you'll have a hard time convincing Joe not to do it. 
He's sold.''

Bill went back into the cabin and closed the door.

``He took that well, don't you think?'' Orville asked.

George said, ``I suppose so.''

Orville said,
``Is everything working out all right for you? Shifts OK? Co-workers?''

George said, ``Everything's fine. Thank you.''

Orville tapped his pipe out on the bumper, then got back into the
cart. ``All right then. Good night, George.''

\tb

George started cooking dinner for two. More and more, Joe spent the
night in a suite at one of the hotels, ``working late.'' George
didn't know what sort of work he was doing, but he sure seemed to
enjoy it. He hardly came back to the cabin at all. The first time
he'd stayed out all night, Bill had gone back to the Island and
gotten Orville out of bed to help him search. After that, Joe
started sending out a runner, usually some poor Ops trainee, to
tell them he wasn't coming back for dinner. Eventually, he stopped
bothering, and Bill stopped worrying.

One night, a month after Orville had come out to the cabin, George
slathered a muskrat's carcass with mayonnaise and lemon and
dragonfly eggs and set it out for him and Joe.

Bill hardly ate, which was usually a signal that he was thinking.
George left him half of the dinner and waited for him to speak.
Bill picked his way through the rest, then pushed his plate away.
George cleared it and brought them both mason jars full of muddy
water from the swamp out back. Bill took his jar out front of the
cabin and leaned against the wall and stared out into the night,
sipping. George joined him.

``We're getting old,'' Bill said, at last.

``Every night, the inside of my uniform is black,'' George said.

``Mine, too. We're getting very old. I think that you're at least thirty, and 
I'm pretty sure that I'm twenty-five. That's old. Our father told me that he 
thought he was fifty, the year he died. And he was very old for one of us.''

George thought of their father on his deathbed, eating the food
they chewed for him, eyes nearly blind, skin crazed with cracks.
``He was very old,'' George said.

Bill held his two whole hands up against the stars.
``When father was my age, he had two sons. Can you remember how proud he was of 
us? How proud he was of himself? He'd done well enough that he could lose both 
his thumbs, and still know that his sons would take care of him.''

George shifted and sighed. He'd been thinking about sons, too.

``I've wanted a son since we came to the Island,'' Bill said.
``I never did anything about it because I couldn't take care of Joe and a son.''
Bill turned to look at George.
``I think Joe's finally taking care of himself.''

George didn't know what to say. If Bill had a son, then he
couldn't. They couldn't both stop working to raise their sons. But
Bill always made the decisions for them. George didn't know what to
say, so he said nothing.

``I'm going to have a son,'' Bill said.

\tb

Bill did it the next night. He told Orville that he'd need a month
off, and after eating the dinner George made for them, he made a
nest of earth and blankets on the floor of their cabin.

George sat in the corner and watched Bill as he stared at his
thumbs. It was the most important decision one of their kind ever
made: a clever son of the left hand, or a strong son of the right.
George knew that his son would come from the left hand. In the
world his father had put them into, cleverness was far more
important than strength. After all, Bill was having the first son.

Bill put his clever left thumb in his mouth and slowly, slowly, bit
down. George felt muddy tears pricking at his eyes. Bill's hand
coursed with silty blood. He ignored it, and used his strong right
hand to take the severed thumb from his mouth and bed it down with
infinite care in the nest he'd built.

George cautiously moved forward to peer at the thumb, which was
already moving blindly in its nest, twisting like a grub. Bill
looked on, his eyes shining.

``It's perfect,'' George breathed.

George felt an uncharacteristic welling up inside him, and he put
his arm around Bill's shoulders. Bill leaned into him, and said,
``Thank you, George. This family wouldn't exist without you.''

They both slept curled around the nest that night.

By morning, the thumb had sprouted tiny arm- and leg-buds, and it
inched itself blindly around the nest. George marveled at it before
going to work.

Joe stopped by his stand that day. His belly was bigger than ever,
and his skin was cracking like their father's had. ``Big guy!'' he
shouted, vaulting the counter into George's stand.
``Where's Bill today? He wasn't at his post.''

George said, ``Bill had a son last night. From his left hand.''

Joe rolled his eyes, which had gone the murky yellow of swamp
water.
``Wonderful, right? Ugh. There are better ways to achieve immortality, bro. I'm 
designing a crawl-through for HorrorZone: you're an earthworm crawling 
underneath a graveyard. It's gonna be huge: maggots as big as horses, chasing 
the Guests through the tunnels; huge ghost hands grabbing at them. We're 
building a giant tombstone as the weenie, you'll be able to see it from 
anywhere on the Island. We'll build out over the midway for HorrorZone --- it's 
the biggest rehab we've done since they brought in electric power.''

As usual, George didn't know what to say to Joe.
``That sounds very nice,'' he said.

Joe rolled his eyes again and started to say something, but stopped
when three Guests came up to George's booth. George hardly
recognised the Mitchell brothers. The youngest was already
three-quarters donkey, so dangerously close that it was a miracle
he hadn't been picked up already. He was hunched over, and his
hands were fused into fists. His hair had grown down over his
shoulders in a coarse mane, and his lips bulged around his
elongated jaws.

The middle and eldest were well on their ways, too. The points of
their ears poked out from under their hair, and they carried
themselves painfully, forcing their legs and hips upright.

George flipped over his phone and punched 911, but left it out of
sight below the counter. Loudly, he said,
``Come on over, boys! You look like you could use one of George's triple-dips, 
the best on the midway!''

From the phone, he heard the security operator say,
``Thank you, George, we'll be along in a moment.'' Surreptitiously,
he racked the receiver and smiled at the boys.

``How are you enjoying your stay, boys?'' he said.

``It'th aw-thome!'' the youngest said around his clumsy teeth.

George handed him a cone piled high with floss, then started
building two more for his brothers. Joe smirked at them. George
hoped he wouldn't say anything before security got there.

The eldest said,
``I don't think my brother's feeling too good. Is there a doctor here I can 
take him to?''

The youngest, face sticky with confection, kicked his brother.
``I'm fine!'' he said. ``I wanna go on more rideth!''

His brother said,
``We'll go on more rides after we see a doctor.''

The youngest dropped to his knees and cried. ``No!'' he said,
hammering his fists on the ground. ``No no no no!'' George watched
in alarm as the boy went all the way over to donkey. His cries
turned to brays, and his shorts split around his haunches and tail.
His shirt went next, and George smoothly vaulted the counter and
stood in front of the donkey, blocking him from passers-by. The
other two made a run for it. George snagged the middle by his
collar, but the boy tore free and took off down the midway. George
looked about wildly for security, but they still hadn't arrived.

Then Joe tore past him, moving faster than George had ever seen him
go. He caught the boys and stuffed one under each arm, kicking and
squirming. He grinned ferociously as he pinned them beneath his
knees at George's feet. He clamped his hands over their mouths.
``Got 'em!'' he said to George.

A security team emerged from the utilidor beside George's booth,
wearing clown makeup and baggy pants. Two of them tranquilised the
boys and the third fitted the donkey out with a halter and bit. The
clown slapped the donkey's haunch appreciatively.
``He's a healthy one.''

The security team disappeared down the utilidor with the Mitchell
brothers: two boys and a donkey. Joe smacked George on the back.
``Did you see me catch them? Like greased lightning! Bounty, here I come!''

George didn't mind sharing his bounty with Joe, so he just smiled
and nodded and went back around to his booth.

\tb

Bill named his son Tom. Names weren't very important to their
people, but the soft ones' world demanded them. Within a week, Tom
was eagerly toddling through their cabin, tasting everything,
exploring everything. His eyes shone with curious brilliance. The
clever son of a clever son.

George loved Bill's son. He loved to watch Tom as he gnawed at
their bedding, as he dug at the floor in search of grubs. Tom was
clearly delighted with his surroundings, and George basked in Tom's
delight. Bill could barely restrain himself from picking Tom up and
hugging him every moment. The only time he left George alone with
Tom was a few precious moments after each evening's meal, when he
would duck into the woods to find some new toy for Tom: a crippled
chipmunk; a handful of pretty rocks; a discarded beer can. The son
built bizarre towers out of them, then knocked them down in a fit
of giggles. Tom ate all day long, and spoke a steady stream of
adorable nonsense.

Bill hardly spoke to George. Their evening meals were given over to
watching the son eat. George didn't mind. Talking to the Guests all
day wore him out.

When Tom was two months old, Joe came by George's booth.

``Well, it's final. Tomorrow, we shut down the midway. Too old-fashioned --- 
it's only stood this long because some of the older Imagineers had an emotional 
attachment to it. I told `em: 'That's \emph{your} demographic, not the 
\emph{target} demographic.' So we're knocking it down. HorrorZone's gonna be 
\emph{huge}.''
He skipped off before George could say anything. His ears were long
and pointed. It wasn't the first time George noticed it, but now,
he could see that Joe's hunched-over gait wasn't just because of
his belly.

George built a dozen cones for the Guests, but his heart wasn't in
it. Besides, most of the Guests already had their hands full of
gummi spiders and snakes, from the Actionland Jungle Treats buffet.
His thoughts were full of Joe, and he turned them over in his slow,
cautious manner. Joe was turning into a donkey. He didn't think
that one of their kind could turn into a donkey, but this was
Pleasure Island. Indulging your vices was a dangerous pastime here.
He should tell Bill, but there was no phone at the cabin. He
couldn't send a runner for him, because this was family business.
His shift wouldn't end for hours yet, and this was too important to
wait.

Finally, he called his Lead.
``I have to get offstage. I'm having a bad day.''

Technically, this was allowed. Management didn't want anyone
onstage who wasn't 100 percent. But it was something that none of
the brothers, not even Joe, had ever done. The Lead was surprised,
but he sent over a soft one to relieve George.

\tb

Orville and Bill were sitting out front of the cabin, watching Tom,
when George got back. He wrung his hands as he approached them, not
sure of what to say, and whether he should talk in front of Orville
at all. He held his left thumb in his right hand, and it comforted
him, a little.

Bill and Orville were so engrossed in Tom's antics that they didn't
even notice George until he cleared his throat. Orville raised his
eyebrows and looked significantly at Bill.

``I just saw Joe,'' George said.
``On the midway. His ears are pointed, and he's walking all hunched over. I 
give him a few days at the most before he's all the way gone.''
George held his breath, waiting for Bill's reaction.

``Too bad,'' Bill said.
``It was inevitable, I suppose. A child of the tongue! What was father 
thinking?''

Orville smiled and puffed at his pipe.
``Don't you worry about it, George. Joe's going to be much, much happier. 
Focussed. If you'd like, I can bring him out here to live. Little Tom could 
have pony rides.''

Bill said,
``I don't think that's such a good idea. Joe's too wild to play with a child.''

Orville put a hand on his shoulder.
``You'd be amazed at how docile he'll become.''

Bill scooped up Tom, who was up to his waist now, and who liked to
grab onto Bill's nose. ``We'll see, then.'' He retreated into the
cabin with his son.

Orville turned to George and said,
``You've probably heard that we're taking down the midway tomorrow. The others 
are all being reassigned until the rehab is done, but I thought I'd see if I 
could get you a couple months off. You could stay here and play with Tom --- 
it's not every day you get to be a new uncle.''

Orville had always taken obvious pleasure in the transformation of
boys into donkeys. It was the whole why of Pleasure Island, after
all. Orville seemed especially pleased tonight, and George thought
that he was as surprised about Bill as George was.

George, not knowing what to say to any of it, said nothing.

\tb

It didn't take long for George to start missing the midway. Stuck
at the cabin with Bill and Tom, he sat against an outside wall and
tried not to get in the way. He prepared meals in silence, taking a
long time in the woods, gathering up choice morsels. Bill and Tom
ate on the floor, away from the table. Bill chewed the tougher
morsels first, and then put them in Tom's mouth with his crippled
left hand. Most of the time, neither of them took any notice of
George.

One day, he prepared a whole day's worth of meals and left them on
the table, then walked to the utilidor at the other side of the
woods. He boarded a tram and rode to the old midway entrance.

The midway was fenced in with tall plywood sheets, and construction
crews bustled over the naked skeletons of the new HorrorZone. Heavy
machinery groaned and crashed. Nothing but the distant silhouettes
of Actionland's skyline were familiar. George tried to imagine
working here for years to come. An overwhelming tiredness weighed
him down.

He took the tram back to the cabin and stripped off his clothes.
They were browner than ever. His arms felt weak and tired. He
suddenly knew that he would never have a son of his own.

Bill and Tom were playing out front of the cabin. He sat in his
usual spot against the wall and watched them. ``Bill,'' he said,
softly.

``Yes?'' Bill said.

``When will I have a son of my own?'' Bill always knew the
answers.

Bill gathered Tom up to his chest unconsciously while he thought.
``I suppose that once Tom is grown, you could take some time off and have a son 
of your own.''

To his own surprise, George said, ``I want to have a son now.''

Bill said,
``That's out of the question, George. We're too busy with Tom.'' On
hearing Bill's annoyed tone, Tom leaned into him.

George said,
``I'm not busy. I am old, though. If I don't have a son soon, I won't be able 
to care for it until it's old enough to care for me.''

Bill said,
``You're thinking like Father. We're living with the soft ones now. Orville 
will make sure that you and your son will be fine until he's grown.''

George never won arguments with Bill. He went inside the cabin and
set out dinner.

\tb

Orville visited the brothers the next morning. He chucked Tom under
the chin and shook hands with Bill. Then he took George out into
the woods for a walk.

``Your brother tells me you want a son of your own,'' he said.

George nodded, and stooped to put a small, mossy log in his
basket.

``Bill doesn't want you to, huh?''

George didn't feel very comfortable discussing the family with
Orville. That was Bill's job. After some thought, he said,
``Not right now.''

Orville said,
``I can see that that makes you unhappy. No one should be unhappy here. I'll 
see what I can do. Come down to Ops tomorrow morning, we'll talk more.''

When George got back to the cabin, Bill was lying on his back on
the floor, laughing while Tom climbed all over him. Tom still
babbled, but they were real words now, though nonsensical. With his
constant talking, he reminded George of Joe, and that made him even
sadder.

\tb

George had never been to Ops before, but he knew where it was, in a
collection of low-slung prefab buildings hidden behind the topiary
sculptures near MagicLand. He clutched his right thumb nervously as
he stood and waited in the reception area for Orville to come and
get him. The secretary had taken his name and buzzed Orville, and
now kept sneaking him horrified looks. George's family were the
only of their kind to leave their homeland and join the soft ones,
and here at Ops, there were any number of low-ranking babus who'd
never heard tell of them.

Orville was all smiles and effusion as he breezed through the glass
security-door and pounded George on the back.
``George! I'm so \emph{glad} you came down!''

He took George by the arm and led him away, stopping to wink at the
secretary, who looked at him with a mixture of disgust and
admiration.

Orville's office was buried in a twisting maze of door-lined,
fluorescent-lit corridors, where busy soft ones talked on
telephones and clattered on keyboards. He led George through his
door, into an office as big as George's cabin.

Orville paced and talked.
``Did I say I was glad you came? I'm glad you came. Now, let's talk about Bill. 
Bill's happy. He's got what he wants. A son. He doesn't have to take care of 
Joe. It's good for him.''

He paused and looked at George. George nodded.

``OK. There's a problem, though. You want a son, too, only Bill won't allow 
it.''

It didn't need any comment, so George kept quiet.

``My thinking is, Bill's so busy with Tom, he wouldn't really notice if you 
were there or not. You're an adult, you can take care of yourself. Do you see 
where I'm going with this?''

George assumed it was a rhetorical question.

``Right. What I'm thinking is, there's no reason that both of you shouldn't 
have your own son. This is Pleasure Island, after all. No one should be sad on 
Pleasure Island. You've worked hard and well for us for a long time here. We 
can take care of you.''

George felt an uncomfortable sensation in his stomach, a knot of
guilt like rising vomit.

``I thought about having another cabin built in the woods, but that's no good. 
I think that you and Bill need your own space. So let me bounce my current 
thought off you: we'll put you up in the new Monster's Arms, that's the hotel 
we're building for HorrorZone. It's way ahead of schedule, almost finished now. 
There's a penthouse suite that you can take for as long as you like. It's only 
temporary, just until you and Bill have had some time to raise up your sons. 
Then, we'll get the whole family together back at the cabin.''

The guilt rose higher, choking George.

``Don't worry about eating, either. I've briefed the house chef on your tastes, 
and he'll send up three squares every day; everything a growing boy needs.''
He flashed a grin.

``And forget about Bill. I'll smooth things over with him. He'll see that it's 
for the best.''

Finally, George had something to say. ``What about Joe?''

Orville had been almost dancing as he spoke, enchanted with his own
words. He pulled up short when George spoke. ``What about him?''

``I want to live with him again,'' George said.

``He's gone, you know that.'' Orville pointed his fingers alongside
his ears.
``Hee-haw, hee-haw. The monthly ferry will take him to the mainland tomorrow.''

``I don't care about that,'' George said. ``I want him there.''

Orville said,
``I don't think that's such a good idea, George. You're going away to 
concentrate on \emph{you} --- Joe's a handful, even now. I don't want you 
distracted.''

George said, ``I want Joe.''

Orville stared at him. George set his face into a blank mask.
Finally, Orville said,
``If that's what you want, that's what you'll get.''

\tb

George didn't have anything to fetch from the cabin, and Orville
thought it would be best if he spoke to Bill alone, so he sent
George to the stables to get Joe.

The donkey stables were beyond Ops, at the very edge of the island,
opposite the docks where the ferries brought new boys in. A
different kind of boat docked there, large utility freighters that
brought in everything the Island needed and took away braying,
kicking herds of jackasses.

The donkeys shifted nervously in their stalls. George smelled
horse-apples and hay, and heard fidgeting hooves and quiet, braying
sobs. He wasn't clear on what happened to donkeys when they went
back to the mainland, but he had an idea that it wasn't very
pleasant. On the Island, donkeys were prizes, a sign that a boy's
every wish had been gratified. What happened afterwards wasn't
something that they were encouraged to think about.

He walked down the clean, wooden aisles, peering into the stalls,
looking for Joe. Finally, in a dark stall in the very darkest
corner of the stables, he found him. A large, pot-bellied jackass,
who leapt up and brayed loudly at him when he clucked his tongue at
it.

``Joe?'' he asked softly.

The donkey brayed again and kicked at the stall's door. It was
already splintered from many such kicks. George opened the catch
and was nearly trampled beneath Joe's hooves as he ran out and
away, braying loudly. George chased his brother. He didn't start
very fast, but once he got going, inertia made him unstoppable.

He cornered Joe at the door that led out to the Island. The donkey
was kicking at it, trying for escape. George locked his strong
right arm around Joe's neck. ``Stop it, Joe,'' he said.
``I'm taking you out with me, but you have to stop it.''

Joe's eyes rolled madly, and he struggled against George, kicking
and biting. George waited in silence until the donkey tired, then
used a bridle hanging on the wall to lead Joe out of the stables.

When Joe saw Orville waiting for them, he went wild again. George
caught him by the hind leg and dragged him to the ground, while
Orville danced back with a strange grace.

Orville grinned and said, ``I guess he doesn't like me very much.''
He came forward and darted an affectionate pat on Joe's haunch.

Joe brayed loudly and George kept his own counsel. Orville led them
down a utilidor and into an electric tram with an open car. George
led Joe in and held onto his neck while Orville sped down the
utilidor. He drove up a service ramp and out into HorrorZone, then
to the doors of the newly completed Monster's Arms.

George and Joe lived in the Monster's Arms. Every morning, Orville
paid them a visit and snuck looks at George's thumbs. They were
intact.

George wanted to have a son, but he couldn't bring himself to do
it. Orville's visits grew shorter, and Orville's manner grew more
irritated. Still, George had no son.

One day, he waited until Joe was napping, and slipped out through
the iron-maiden elevator, right down into the utilidor.

The tram driver recognised him and took him out to the cabin. The
last mile of the utilidor was dusty and disused. George leaped off
the tram and walked quickly to the cabin, his heart racing. It had
been so long since he'd seen Bill and little Tom. He missed them
terribly.

The little cabin was even smaller than George remembered it, and it
looked sad, sagging and ramshackle. He hesitated at the door, then,
feeling a stranger, knocked.

There was movement inside, but no voices, and the door stayed shut.
George opened the door.

It was a disaster. The kitchen cupboards were smashed in, the
little table knocked over and splintered, the bedding scattered and
soiled. Deep shadows collected in the corners.

``Bill?'' George called, softly. A shadow stirred, an indistinct
figure within its depths.

``Bill, it's George. I missed you. I need to talk with you. I'm confused.''

The shadow stirred again. George crept forward, peering, his old
eyes night-dimmed.

Bill huddled in the corner, wracked and wasted. He stared up at
George through eyes filmed with tears. He held up his hands. They
had already begun to shape themselves into hooves, but George could
still see that both his thumbs were gone. His ears were pointed and
long.

``Oh, Bill,'' George said.

His brother let out a braying sob, and George saw he had no
tongue.

\tb

Orville came looking for them the next morning.

``Where are the sons?'' George asked him, while stroking the
donkey's head in his lap.

Orville smiled a slightly abashed smile.
``I'm keeping them safe. I didn't think that Bill was in any shape to take care 
of them.''

George said,
``I'll take care of them. Bring them here. Joe, too --- he's in the room. I'll 
take care of them all.''

Orville smiled his abashed smile again, then gave George an ironic
salute. ``Yes, sir,'' he said. He patted Bill's haunch and smiled
to himself.

George didn't know how to respond to irony, so he held his brother
more tightly. Eventually, Orville went away, and then came back a
while after that. He drove an electric cart. In the front seat,
three sons bounced --- Tom, bright and curious; another, strong and
big; a third, whose little pot belly jiggled as he talked and
talked and talked. In a trailer, Joe kicked and fought against his
bonds.

George let him out first, then took the sons to the porch. Joe and
Bill stared at each other for a long moment, then Bill brayed out a
long, donkeyish laugh.

Orville looked with proprietary satisfaction at the donkeys, then
at the sons, then at George. He waggled a finger at George, as if
to say, \emph{I'll be back for you, someday}. Then he got into his
tram and drove off.

George went back inside and made dinner for his family.
