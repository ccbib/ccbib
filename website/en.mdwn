# Creative Commons Bibliothek

In the
Creative Commons Library
there are:

* only [[free|Was]] books or texts
* an [[online|Code]] printing template for every text
* the tools to reproduce lost books

We have regular [[opening hours/meetings|en/locations]] and a [newsletter
(so far german only)](https://lists.ccbib.org/wws/subscribe/de-news).
We are interested in your ideas for improvement and would like to hear
about new projects!
